## Vision

> **Every business will have an agentic operator. FlowWink is the operating system it runs on — and it lets you bring your own operator.**

## Mission

> **Give every business a self-hosted, fully-featured SaaS platform that any agent can operate via an open protocol — with a great default operator included, and the freedom to swap it out for whatever the agent ecosystem produces next.**

---

## A new kind of business software

For decades, business software has been a collection of tools you operate manually — CMS, CRM, ERP, email, e-commerce — each requiring human input at every step.

**FlowWink is a Business Operating System (BOS):** a unified, modular platform where every module (66 across CMS, CRM, commerce, finance, HR, operations) exposes its capabilities as **agent skills over MCP**. An operator — local or external — turns those skills into autonomous business outcomes.

You set the direction. The operator runs the business. You choose which operator.

| Profile | Recommended operator |
|---|---|
| SMB, no agent stack, wants "it just works" | **FlowPilot** (built-in) |
| Already runs OpenClaw / Claude Desktop / custom MCP | **External**, FlowPilot off |
| Wants belt-and-braces — local heartbeat + external power | **Both**, on the same skill catalog |
| Pure SaaS, humans in the loop | **Neither** — modules work without an agent |

All four are first-class. Disabling FlowPilot does **not** reduce what FlowWink can do — every skill is still callable over MCP, every automation still fires. See [`docs/concepts/operator-strategy.md`](docs/concepts/operator-strategy.md) and [`docs/architecture/mcp-as-platform.md`](docs/architecture/mcp-as-platform.md).

> **Why this matters:** the rationale for letting traditional SaaS be orchestrated by agents — and the architecture that makes it work — is the subject of the **[Agentic Handbook (clawable)](https://www.clawable.org)**. FlowWink is the reference implementation.

## What FlowPilot does

FlowPilot is not a chatbot, a copilot, or a content suggester. It is an **autonomous agent** — a persistent process that wakes up on a configurable schedule (default: every 6 hours), reads your business situation, and acts.

| Qualifies and enriches leads | Scores, enriches from domain, routes to deals |
| Sends newsletter campaigns | Segments subscribers, drafts, schedules sends |
| Manages product promotions | Creates landing pages, promotional posts |
| Triages support tickets | Auto-categorizes, routes, resolves from Knowledge Base |
| Reviews deal pipeline | Surfaces stale deals, drafts re-engagement |
| Proposes new objectives | Reads site stats, spots gaps, creates its own goals |
| Federates with peer agents | Delegates tasks to external A2A agents via JSON-RPC |
| Evolves its own capabilities | Creates new skills, updates its instructions, reflects |

## Modules — 66 integrated domains

FlowWink follows an **Odoo-inspired modular architecture** where each module owns its data, views, and skill seeds. Modules register via `defineModule()` with typed contracts.

| Category | Modules |
|----------|---------|
| **Content** | Website (Pages), Blog, Knowledge Base, Docs, Wiki, Handbook, Media Library, Templates, Forms, Site Migration |
| **CRM & Sales** | Contacts, Companies, Deals, Quotes, Sales Intelligence, Customer 360, Business Identity, Visitor Intelligence |
| **Commerce** | E-commerce, Point of Sale, Bookings, Subscriptions, Inventory, Pricelists, Returns / RMA, Shipping, Manufacturing (MRP-light) |
| **Finance** | Accounting (BAS 2024 / IFRS / US GAAP), Quotes & Invoicing, Expense Reporting, Reconciliation, Purchasing, Fixed Assets, Multi-Currency |
| **HR & People** | HR & Employees, Payroll, Recruitment, Consultants, Timesheets, Contracts, Documents |
| **Operations** | Projects, Field Service, Maintenance, Approvals, SLA Monitor, Calendar, Surveys & NPS |
| **Communication** | Email Router, Newsletter, AI Chat, Live Support, Tickets (Kanban + auto-triage), FlowWork, River, Webinars, WebMeet, Voice |
| **Data & Growth** | Flowtable (agent data layer), Analytics, Paid Growth |
| **System & Operator** | FlowPilot, Federation (A2A + MCP), Browser Control, Composio, Developer |

Every module is enabled by the **FlowWink Platform** template — since the edge
surface was consolidated behind `agent-execute`, turning a module on costs skill
rows and navigation, not deployment slots.

Each module provides:
- **Data layer** — Supabase tables + RLS policies + RPCs
- **Admin UI** — React pages under `/admin/`
- **Skill seeds** — capabilities auto-registered into `agent_skills` and exposed over MCP
- **Webhook events** — `module.action` signals on the platform event bus

Composite MCP groups (`marketing`, `sales`, `operations`, …) let an external operator request a curated toolkit with `?groups=marketing` — no need to know the internal taxonomy.

---

## Skills — 500+ capabilities, exposed over MCP

| Domain | Sample skills |
|--------|---------------|
| **CMS & Content** | `manage_page`, `manage_blog_post`, `manage_kb_article`, `manage_global_block`, `migrate_url`, `scrape_url` |
| **CRM** | `manage_leads`, `manage_companies`, `manage_deals`, `qualify_lead`, `enrich_company`, `process_signal` |
| **Commerce** | `manage_product`, `place_order`, `record_pos_sale_v2`, `close_pos_session_v2`, `manage_subscription` |
| **Finance** | `manage_journal_entry`, `import_bank_image`, `reconcile_transaction`, `auto_approve_vendor_invoice`, `book_expense`, `mark_paid` |
| **HR & People** | `hire_application`, `auto_allocate_vacation`, `lock_timesheet_period`, `manage_contract`, `manage_employee` |
| **Procure-to-Pay** | `generate_expense`, `submit_expense`, `approve_expense`, `book_expense`, `create_purchase_order`, `receive_goods` |
| **Operations** | `manage_project`, `manage_task`, `manage_field_service`, `sla_check`, `dispatch_automation_event` |
| **Communication** | `send_newsletter_campaign`, `manage_webinar`, `upload_document` |
| **Support** | `triage_ticket`, KB-powered auto-resolve |
| **Intelligence** | `search_web`, `extract_pdf_text`, `competitor_monitor`, `prospect_research` |
| **Operator-internal** *(FlowPilot only, not MCP)* | objectives, soul, reflect, planning, A2A delegation |

All skills follow Anthropic's MCP best practices: self-describing (`Use when:` / `NOT for:`), flat OpenAI-strict-mode-safe JSON Schemas, namespaced. See [`docs/architecture/mcp-as-platform.md`](docs/architecture/mcp-as-platform.md).

---

## Knowledge — one index, every surface

**Most products bolt search on top of the systems. FlowWink has the memory built in — the same knowledge, different eyes, no extra product and no data leaving your instance.**

Six content sources — pages, knowledge base, wiki, docs, handbook, documents — feed a single embedded index. Every grounded surface reads from it:

| Who is asking | What they can retrieve |
|---|---|
| A visitor in the public chat | Public content only — published pages and KB articles |
| Staff in FlowWork | Public *and* internal — wiki, handbook, documents, contracts, CRM |
| An external agent over MCP | Whatever its key's scopes allow |

Visibility is a property of the content, enforced by row-level security — not a filter the calling surface remembers to apply. A source whose module is switched off stops being indexed (nobody pays to embed content they turned off), and answers carry citations that link back to the record they came from.

Retrieval is the default because it scales; when the index cannot answer — a brand-new instance, a page published a minute ago, no embedding key — grounding falls back to full text rather than to nothing. Degrade, never gate.

See [`docs/architecture/retrieval-engine.md`](docs/architecture/retrieval-engine.md) and [`docs/architecture/conversation-and-retrieval.md`](docs/architecture/conversation-and-retrieval.md).

---

## FlowPilot — the included operator

FlowPilot is FlowWink's **vertically-integrated, local autonomous operator** — one of many possible MCP consumers, but the one that ships in the box. It runs *inside* the platform's trust boundary, which gives it advantages no external operator can replicate: zero-config onboarding, direct DB/event access, brand-aligned defaults, predictable cost.

External operators like **[OpenClaw](https://www.clawable.org)** instead win on velocity, plugin ecosystem and frontier reasoning. FlowWink supports both — see [`docs/concepts/operator-strategy.md`](docs/concepts/operator-strategy.md) for the honest trade-off.

### Heartbeat Protocol (7 steps)

```
1. EVALUATE  — Score past actions against real outcomes (traffic, leads, revenue)
2. PLAN      — Decompose active objectives into executable steps
3. ADVANCE   — Execute the next pending step for each objective
4. PROPOSE   — If no active objectives, analyze stats and create new goals
5. AUTOMATE  — Detect recurring patterns, suggest or create automations
6. REFLECT   — Review recent actions, distill learnings
7. REMEMBER  — Save insights to semantic memory for future cycles
```

### Workflow DAGs — Multi-step automation chains

```
Research topic → Write blog post → Create social posts → Schedule newsletter
     s1               s2                  s3                    s4
                  {{s1.topic}}     {{s2.post_id}}         {{s3.content}}
```

- **Template variables** — `{{stepId.result.field}}` passes data between steps
- **Conditional branching** — run a step only if a previous result meets a condition
- **Failure modes** — `on_failure: continue` or `stop` per step

### Outcome Evaluation Loop

FlowPilot uses **causal correlation** to connect actions to business outcomes:
- Traffic metrics, leads, bookings, and revenue signals
- Hard gates for technical failures (timeout, 429, auth errors)
- Skill Scorecard — flags underperforming skills (>60% negative rate)
- Learnings saved to semantic memory for the next planning cycle

### Multi-Agent Delegation

FlowPilot delegates subtasks to specialist sub-agents with persistent sessions:

```
FlowPilot → delegate_task("seo", "analyze /pricing page")
         → delegate_task("content", "write a case study about...")
         → delegate_task("sales", "review stale deals > $10k")
```

Built-in specialists: **seo**, **content**, **sales**, **analytics**, **email** — each maintains conversation history across invocations.

### Skill Packs

```
skill_pack_install("E-Commerce Pack")        → product_promoter, cart_recovery_check, inventory_report
skill_pack_install("Content Marketing Pack") → content_calendar_view, seo_content_brief, social_post_batch
skill_pack_install("CRM Nurture Pack")       → lead_pipeline_review, deal_stale_check, customer_health_digest
```

---

## Federation — MCP + A2A

FlowWink speaks two open protocols so any operator can connect:

- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** — the primary surface. 600+ skills exposed as tools, resources like `flowwink://briefing`, group filtering via `?groups=marketing`. Works with Claude Desktop, OpenClaw, custom MCP clients.
- **A2A (Agent-to-Agent JSON-RPC 2.0)** — peer-to-peer delegation between agents.

```
┌─────────────┐   MCP / A2A    ┌────────────────────┐
│  FlowWink   │◄──────────────▶│  Operator           │
│  Platform   │   tools/call   │  • FlowPilot (local)│
│ (modules +  │   resources    │  • OpenClaw         │
│ (modules +  │   message/send │  • Claude Desktop   │
│  600+ skills)│                │  • custom           │
                                └────────────────────┘
```

- **Directional connections** — peers can be inbound (MCP), outbound (`/v1/responses`) or bidirectional (A2A)
- **Graceful degradation** — 503 `peer_unavailable` handling when peers are offline
- **Audit loop** — architectural findings from peers auto-convert to platform objectives
- **Agent Card** — `/.well-known/agent.json` discovery endpoint

---

## Architecture

FlowWink follows the **OpenClaw** agentic architecture — composable layers with clear separation of concerns:

### One reasoning core, all surfaces

The Pilot engine (`_shared/pilot/`) is the single engine shared by every surface:
- **`agent-operate`** — interactive admin sessions (streaming)
- **`flowpilot-heartbeat`** — autonomous scheduled loop
- **`chat-completion`** — visitor-facing AI chat
- **`a2a-ingest`** — incoming federation requests

No logic duplication. All surfaces get every capability automatically.

### Modularized core

```
_shared/
├── pilot/
│   ├── reason.ts          — Main ReAct reasoning loop
│   ├── prompt-compiler.ts — System prompt assembly
│   ├── handlers.ts        — Built-in tool implementations
│   └── built-in-tools.ts  — Tool definitions
├── types.ts               — Shared type definitions
├── ai-config.ts           — Provider routing (OpenAI → Gemini → Local)
├── concurrency.ts         — Lane-based locking
├── token-tracking.ts      — Budget management
├── trace.ts               — Correlation IDs (fp_{ts}_{rand})
└── domains/
    └── cms-context.ts     — CMS domain pack
```

### Provider-agnostic, self-hosted first

```
OpenAI GPT-4o → Gemini 2.5 Flash → Local LLM (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM)
```

FlowPilot routes to whichever provider is configured. Use your own API keys. Run fully offline with a local model. No vendor lock-in.

## What FlowWink replaces

FlowWink draws inspiration from the best-in-class platforms across every business domain — and unifies them under one autonomous operator.

| Category | Platforms that inspired | FlowWink's BOS module |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Website** | WordPress, Webflow, Squarespace, Weebly | Visual block editor, 50+ blocks, headless API |
| **CRM & Sales** | HubSpot, Pipedrive, Salesforce | Leads, deals, companies — AI-qualified and enriched |
| **Email & Marketing** | Mailchimp, Klaviyo, ConvertKit | Newsletter with autonomous segmentation and campaigns |
| **Booking** | Calendly, Acuity | Service bookings with AI follow-up |
| **Support** | Zendesk, Freshdesk, Intercom | Tickets + live chat with AI triage from Knowledge Base |
| **Content & Copy** | Jasper, Copy.ai, Surfer SEO | FlowPilot writes, optimizes, and publishes into CMS |
| **Automation** | Zapier, n8n, Make | Workflow DAGs with conditional branching |
| **E-Commerce** | Shopify, WooCommerce | Products, orders, inventory, Stripe checkout |
| **Finance** | QuickBooks, Xero, FreshBooks | Invoicing, double-entry accounting, expenses |
| **Time Tracking** | Toggl, Harvest, Clockify | Timesheets with project-based tracking |
| **ERP** | Odoo, ERPNext | Modular architecture — 66 domains, one platform |
| **Headless CMS** | Contentful, Storyblok, Strapi | REST + GraphQL content API, multi-channel delivery |

**The difference:** those platforms give you tools. FlowWink gives you an operator that *uses* the tools.

One operating system. One operator. Self-host free.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | React 18, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS |
| UI Components | shadcn/ui, Radix UI |
| Backend | Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions) |
| Agent Engine | Deno edge functions, OpenAI function-calling format |
| Editor | Tiptap |
| State | TanStack Query |
| AI Providers | OpenAI, Google Gemini, Local LLM (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM) |
| Federation | A2A JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol |

---

## Self-Hosting

FlowWink is **free to self-host**. Your agent, your data, your infrastructure.

### Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magnusfroste/flowwink.git
cd flowwink
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
npm run dev   # migrations run automatically
```

### Deploy without a CLI — fork, Vercel, Supabase, done

The recommended path for a new instance needs **no local tooling at all** — three
dashboards and a push. Proven end-to-end on a fresh instance: 385 migrations,
77 edge functions, storage, cron and a working public site, zero terminal
commands.

1. **Fork this repo** and create a [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) project from your fork.
2. **Create a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project.** From Project Settings → API Keys, copy the **Project URL** and the **publishable key** (`sb_publishable_…`).
3. **Set two Vercel env vars** — `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` — then redeploy. (An unconfigured deploy shows a "connect your backend" page instead of a blank screen, so you always know where you are.)
4. **Pair Supabase's GitHub integration** with your fork and pick the production branch. It applies every pending migration and deploys every edge function declared in `supabase/config.toml` on each push. *Pairing alone may not fire it — push a commit if nothing happens.*
5. **Log in.** On a virgin instance the first account automatically becomes admin.
6. **Admin → Modules → "Sync skills from code"** — the one step migrations don't cover, because skills come from the module seeds in the frontend bundle.
7. Install a template, add an AI provider key, and (optionally) mint an operator key for an external agent.

Full walkthrough, the verification queries, and the known first-run retry:
**[docs/operators/provisioning-without-cli.md](docs/operators/provisioning-without-cli.md)**.

### Operations — how updates reach a running instance

A site is **four layers**, each with its own delivery rail. The CLI-free stack
moves three of them with a single fork sync:

| Layer | Source of truth | How it updates |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Schema** | `supabase/migrations/*.sql` | Fork sync → Supabase GitHub integration applies pending migrations |
| **Edge functions** | `supabase/functions/*` | Same push — every function declared in `config.toml` redeploys |
| **Frontend** | this repo | Same push — Vercel rebuilds |
| **Skills** | `src/lib/modules/*` (`skillSeeds`) | **Admin → Modules → "Sync skills from code"** after the frontend deploy |

The fourth layer is the one to remember: migrations never touch `agent_skills`.
The sync button re-runs the module bootstrap from the freshly deployed bundle,
refreshing every skill definition while leaving runtime `trust_level` overrides
alone. It checks whether a newer build is live and reloads first, so a stale tab
cannot write stale seeds.

Migrations are **forward-only by construction**: a CI gate blocks any migration
timestamped at or below the current head, because a back-dated file is silently
skipped by the ledger on instances already past it — the drift class this repo
learned the hard way.

### Running it yourself with the CLI

Prefer terminal tooling, or maintaining several instances at once?

```bash
supabase link --project-ref <your-ref>
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy --project-ref <your-ref>

# Sync skill metadata from code into agent_skills (the step that prevents drift).
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:<pw>@db.<your-ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres' \
  npm run sync:skills -- --apply
```

Multi-site operators: **[docs/operators/provisioning-and-updates.md](docs/operators/provisioning-and-updates.md)**
covers the fleet runbook, the `sync:skills` tool and fork vs. auto-deploy
topology. See **[docs/guides/deployment.md](docs/guides/deployment.md)** for the
full walkthrough.
