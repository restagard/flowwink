/**
 * Guardrail: surfaces everyone needs stay reachable by everyone.
 *
 * Access is decided by TWO gates, and only one of them is data:
 *   1. the nav group's hardcoded `adminOnly` / `allowedRoles`
 *   2. the module matrix (role_module_access), via `item.moduleId`
 *
 * The route guard runs the same rules as the sidebar, so an item in the wrong
 * group is not merely hidden — the page is refused. Two of those shipped:
 *
 *   • Profile sat in the adminOnly "Admin" group, so every non-admin was denied
 *     THEIR OWN PROFILE PAGE, on every instance. The guard's first line is
 *     `if (group.adminOnly) return false`; the matrix was never consulted.
 *   • FlowWork — everyone's workroom — sat in the support-only group, a second
 *     gate on top of the matrix, so granting workspaceChat alone did nothing.
 *
 * Neither was catchable by the module matrix work, because neither was a matrix
 * problem. This test asserts the group placement directly: a personal or shared
 * surface must resolve to "allowed" for a role that has been granted its module
 * — and, for surfaces with no module at all, for every role unconditionally.
