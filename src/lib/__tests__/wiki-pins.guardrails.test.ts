/**
 * A pin is where one colleague keeps their hands — not a claim about the team.
 *
 * The wiki tree is alphabetical and hierarchical, which is right for finding a
 * page you have never opened and wrong for returning to the four you open every
 * day. Pins are the shortcut past the hierarchy; the hierarchy itself stays the
 * team-level answer to "this matters" (parent it high and everyone sees it).
 *
 * Built to stay out of the local session's way: a new hook file plus WikiTree,
 * which had not been touched since 2026-08-08 — while WikiPage.tsx took four
 * changes in three days and one the morning this landed. No migration, no
 * schema change, no shared file in flight.
