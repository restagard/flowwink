/**
 * Guardrail: supabase/seed/instance-manifest.json must stay in sync with the
 * tree it describes. The manifest is the repo's desired state per layer
 * (schema head, skill-seed hash, edge-function hashes) — a stale manifest
 * would make the Instance Sync card and fleet tooling compare live instances
 * against the WRONG expectation, which is worse than no comparison at all.
 *
 * The generator is deterministic (no timestamps, no git SHA), so this is an
 * exact compare. CI rebuilds every generated artifact before the tests run
 * (scripts/generated-artifacts.ts), so here it fails only when the generator
 * itself disagrees with the tree. Locally: npm run artifacts:build — and do NOT
 * commit the result; refresh-generated-artifacts.yml commits it on main.
