/**
 * A booked verification is never unbooked.
 *
 * Until 2026-08-10, action=void marked the original status='voided' AND wrote a
 * reversal with status='posted'. Every report in the platform filters
 * status='posted', so the original dropped out while its reversal kept counting:
 * each report was wrong by the NEGATIVE of the voided amount. Proven live on dev
 * — book 12 500 kr incl. 25 % VAT, void it, and the VAT return reports boxes
 * 05/10/49 as minus. A voided sale read as a VAT refund, with no error anywhere.
 *
 * The fix is a model, not a patch: the original stays posted, the reversal
 * cancels it, and the link lives in data (reversed_by / reverses) rather than in
 * status. Two mirrored posted entries sum to zero on their own — so correctness
 * stops depending on every future reader remembering to exclude something.
