 * An invited agent's very first instruction is "read flowwink://mission". That

 *
 * federation-invite-peer minted the key, created the peer, and recorded the link
 * in the (since retired) connection ledger — but left a2a_peers.api_key_id NULL. The MCP
 * gateway resolves a caller to its peer through exactly that column, found
 * nothing, and auto-registered a SECOND peer named after the key. The invited
 * peer kept the mission and no key; the duplicate got the key and no mission.
 * Both rows looked fine on their own, and the agent was told it had no mission.
