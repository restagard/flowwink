### What it repairs
An invoice only reaches the ledger when it is booked. Invoices created directly
in a bookable status — a subscription with auto_finalize, an import, a webshop
order booked on an instance that had no accounting locale yet — can carry a
real receivable that the general ledger never saw.

### How to run it
Dry run first, and **report the amount**: \`receivable_cents_off_the_books\` is
the number that matters to a human, not the invoice count. Then run it for real.

Nothing is double-booked: an invoice with an existing entry is skipped.

### When it comes back with failures
\`failed\` lists each invoice and why. The two common reasons:
- *no accounting locale* — activate a locale pack first, then re-run
- *Paid amount is zero* — the invoice says paid but records no amount. Its
  receivable is booked; the payment is not. Fix the amount, then re-run.`,

PREFERRED ONE-CALL FLOW (templates): find the template via manage_accounting_template action=list (or let matching pick one from description), then call {action:'create', template_id, amount_cents: <NET amount in öre/cents>, description, auto_confirm:true}. Percentage lines (debit_pct/credit_pct) expand from amount_cents — a 25%-VAT sale with amount_cents=100000 books 1510:125000 / 3010:100000 / 2610:25000. Zero-amount entries are rejected.
BANK EVENTS: when booking a bank transaction (from propose_bookkeeping / list_unmatched_transactions / an imported feed), ALWAYS pass bank_transaction_id in the create payload. It links the entry to the event (removes it from the "events to book" queue, audit trail) AND is the idempotency key — re-booking an already-linked event is refused with {already_booked:true} instead of creating a duplicate. Booking bank events WITHOUT bank_transaction_id leaves them in the queue and risks double-booking.
STAGED OPERATION: create returns {staged:true, operation_id, ...} for review — this is NOT a failure and NOT a permission error. To execute: (1) call approve_pending_operation with {p_id: <operation_id>}, then (2) re-invoke manage_journal_entry with the SAME args plus _approved_operation_id: <operation_id>. The entry is only booked after step 2.
CORRECTING A MISTAKE (action=void): it does not delete and it does not hide. The original stays posted and keeps counting; a mirror entry dated TODAY cancels it, and the response gives you both ids. Two consequences to plan around: (1) a June entry reversed in August leaves June's VAT return exactly as it was filed and puts the correction in August's — that is correct, not a bug, and you should say so rather than trying to backdate; (2) reversing twice is refused, because the second reversal would put the books off by the same amount in the other direction — if the correction itself was wrong, book a NEW entry. Entries still in draft can be deleted outright; posted ones never can.
Routing rules in order: (1) vendor.default_account_code wins; (2) keyword-match against accounting_templates ordered by usage_count DESC; (3) only fall back to manual account selection if no template scores ≥0.6 and the vendor has no default. Always include template_id and vendor_id in the create payload when known. Locale-specific guidance: ${getActivePack().ai_instructions.journal_entry}`,

## How you will normally reach this
Run prepare_vat_return first. Its \`coverage\` block lists every account that
carried money in the period and belongs to no box. That list IS the work: each
entry is one add. An empty list means there is nothing to do here.

## Which box
Match by MEANING, not by number. 2611 and 2614 are one digit apart and belong to
different boxes (domestic output VAT vs reverse charge), which is exactly the
kind of neighbourly-looking guess that produces a wrong but plausible filing.
Read the account NAME from action=list, and when the meaning is not obvious from
the name, ask rather than pick.

## What it does not do
It changes reporting, not history. Amounts already posted are included from the
next time the return is prepared — the map is read at report time. And nothing
here moves money or changes where future entries land; that is

    instructions: `## Why a verification without underlying documents is incomplete
The amounts can be perfect and the entry still fails its purpose: BFL 5:7 says a
verification shall identify the documents that underlie it. An auditor asked to
believe a 12 500 kr sale wants to see the invoice, not the bookkeeper's word.

## Attach in the same call when you can
manage_journal_entry takes a \`documents\` array on create. If you have just read
a receipt or a bank statement, attach it there — a second call is a second
chance to forget. This skill is for the entries that already exist.

## file or document
- **file** — an artifact that belongs to this verification and nothing else: a
  receipt, a supplier invoice PDF. Needs file_url; upload_document first if all
  you have is bytes.
- **document** — something already in the archive that underlies SEVERAL
  verifications: an annual report, a bank statement covering a whole year, a
  board minute. Reference it by document_id so it is stored once. Removing the
  link never removes the archived document.

## The label is what a human reads
"Kvitto" tells nobody which one. "Kvitto Circle K 2024-03-11" or "Kontoutdrag
SEB 2024" lets a reviewer match the paper to the entry without opening it. Write
the label as the person checking the books would say it out loud.

## What it does not do
It changes no amount, no account and no date. Attaching evidence to an entry
that is wrong does not make it right — fix the entry with manage_journal_entry
(which reverses rather than rewrites) and attach the evidence to the correction.`,

    instructions: `## Why this is ~20 decisions and not 1200
A company arriving from another system brings its whole chart — a real Bokio
export had 1 243 accounts. Mapping those against ours would be a week nobody
finishes. But FlowWink posts to ROLES, not account numbers, and there are ~23 of
them. In that same file exactly 29 accounts had any balance or movement at all;
the other 1 214 were the standard chart shipped whether you use it or not.

So: run read_sie_file, keep the accounts with a balance or movement, send those.

## Read the answer, do not skim it
- **exact** — they already post where we do. Nothing to do.
- **candidates** — they post somewhere else in that group, and the accounts are
  listed. THIS is the migration. Their history decides what their books mean: a
  company that has booked revenue to 3011 for five years must keep doing so, or
  every FlowWink entry lands on a different account than their own past and any
  parallel comparison diverges from the first invoice.
  One candidate is usually the answer. Several, or none that fit, means the role
  has no counterpart in their books — say so instead of forcing one.
- **no_evidence** — nothing in that account group moved. Leave it. An untouched
  role is not a problem to solve.

## The list you will actually feel
\`accounts_missing_from_chart\` is the accounts they post to that this instance
has never heard of. Moving between systems is mostly this list — the same reason
a Bokio→Dooer move forces re-mapping: the new system simply does not have the
accounts the old one gave you. Add the ones that carry real activity with
manage_chart_of_accounts BEFORE pointing a role at them; \`set\` refuses an
account that does not exist, on purpose, because the alternative is a posting
failure mid-invoice.

## What set does, and the entry it hands back
It changes where FUTURE postings land. Entries already booked keep the account
code they were written with — bookkeeping is not retroactively rewritten.

That alone is honest and leaves the customer with the same figure reported on two
accounts. So when the old account still carries a balance, the response includes
\`suggested_transfer\`: a balanced, dated, self-describing entry that moves it.
BOOK IT with manage_journal_entry — it is deliberately not booked here, because a
role change may not quietly write a verification and manage_journal_entry owns
the staging and approval rail.

This is what a real system does. When LiteIT moved from Bokio to Dooer, Dooer
booked "Change to Dooer kontoplan" on the closing date, moving 4 000 kr from 3011
to 3001 and 764,40 from 6230 to 6200. The migration became auditable instead of
invisible — and that is the whole difference between a chart change and a hole in
the accounts.`,

This is the one rule that cannot be recovered from later. SIE 4 is IBM CP437;
Bokio still writes it that way (a real 2023 export encodes ö as the single byte
0x94). Every ordinary file-reading tool decodes UTF-8, 0x94 is not valid UTF-8,
and the character becomes U+FFFD. No skill can undo that. Read binary,
base64-encode, send.

## What comes back, and why each part matters
- **encoding**: what the file DECLARED (\`#FORMAT\`) versus what its bytes
  actually are. They disagree when a file has been opened and re-saved. The
  bytes win — decoding by the declaration would corrupt it a second time.
- **integrity.replacement_chars**: characters already destroyed before the file
  reached us. Non-zero means: go find the original export from the accounting
  system. The import will still work, but every Swedish letter in names is lost,
  and it was not FlowWink that lost it.
- **contains**: counts per section, plus \`unbalanced_verifications\` — a
  verification whose lines do not sum to zero is a defect in the source file.

## The three destinations
A SIE file is not one import. It is three, and the customer may want any subset:

1. **accounts** — the customer's EXISTING chart (~1200 rows). This is NOT a
   published standard: do not send it to import_accounting_standard. Matching it
   against FlowWink's locale pack is a mapping job with a human in it.
2. **opening_balances** — \`#IB\` rows, one fiscal year at a time, into
   manage_opening_balances. \`#IB 0\` is the year in \`#RAR 0\`; -1 is the year
   before.
3. **verifications** — what the company ACTUALLY books. Group the recurring
   patterns and send them to propose_posting_templates. This is the section
   FlowWink can never guess on its own, and the reason to read the file at all.

## Size
Full lists are opt-in through \`include\` because a real chart is ~1200 rows and
would flood a context for a caller who only wanted the balances.`,

1. **Names verbatim.** Never paraphrase, translate or "improve" an account name.
   Our own chart once carried 2614's name on 2611 — ordinary VAT went down a
   reverse-charge path in four templates, and the label misled the person who
   tried to fix it.
2. **Provenance or nothing.** source_url must be the publisher's own address and
   source_sha256 the hash of the exact file you parsed. The call REFUSES without
   them: an unsourced chart is unverifiable forever.
3. **Roles make it live.** The engine resolves bank/accounts_receivable/
   accounts_payable/sales_revenue/vat_output/vat_input through account_roles —
   map them to the codes the standard prescribes for those functions. Wrong role
   mapping = every invoice posts to the wrong account, with a perfectly valid

The chart says which accounts EXIST. It says nothing about what this company
DOES. If you have access to the company's transaction history (a ledger export,
last year's bank feed, an SIE file), mine it: group the recurring transactions —
rent, the SaaS subscriptions, fuel, the two kinds of sales, payroll — and write
one template per recurring pattern. Aim for the patterns that cover ~90% of
transaction volume; a company rarely needs more than 30–50 to start. Without
history, author the standard set for the country instead (domestic sale per VAT
rate, EU purchase, payroll run, VAT settlement, bank fees…).

## The verification you are writing against
- **Balance**: Σ debit_pct = Σ credit_pct, both > 0. Percentages of the NET
  amount (base=100). Example DE 19%: 1400 debit 119 / 8400 credit 100 /
  1776 credit 19.
- **Accounts must exist** in the locale's chart — run import_accounting_standard
  first, and never invent a code.
- **Names are the chart's.** Any account_name you send is REPLACED by the
  chart's name and reported under name_corrections. Templates carrying their own
  wording is how four VAT templates kept a wrong account for months.
- **Keywords matter**: they are what the matching engine uses to find the
  template from a transaction description. Use the words that appear in this
  company's actual bank descriptions, in the local language.
