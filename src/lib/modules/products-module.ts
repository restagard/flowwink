    instructions: `## manage_product
### What
Manages products in the catalog: list, get, create, update, archive, delete.
### When to use
- Admin asks to add, edit or retire products
- E-commerce setup workflows
### Parameters
- **action**: Required. list, get, create, update, archive, delete.
- **product_id**: Identifies the product for get/update/archive/delete. A unique **name** works too.
- **name**: Product name (create/update).
- **price_cents**: Price in cents (create/update).
- **description**: Product description.
- **weight_grams**: Weight in grams (create/update). null/omitted = non-shippable service or digital product; set it for physical goods so checkout can offer weight-based delivery options.
- **track_inventory / stock_quantity / low_stock_threshold / allow_backorder / cost_cents / barcode / category_id**: accepted on create as well as update — a physical product should be born stocked rather than created and patched.
### Edge cases
- Price is in cents (e.g., 9900 = $99.00 or 99 SEK).
- track_inventory defaults to false. A product created without it is untracked: it never shows in list_stock, never triggers a low-stock alert and is never a reorder candidate.
- allow_backorder=false (the default) makes order lines above the on-hand quantity fail with the available number in the error. Set it true to accept backorders — stock_quantity then goes negative, and the negative IS the backorder depth.
- archive sets is_active=false: the product leaves browse_products, list_stock and the low-stock loop, but every order line, stock move and quote keeps its reference. Reactivate with update + is_active:true.
- delete is a HARD delete for a product with no history (a typo, a duplicate, a test row). Once the product appears in order lines, stock moves, quotes, purchase orders, returns, POS sales, subscriptions or manufacturing orders the delete is refused with the counts — archive instead.
- SKU lives on variants, not products — use manage_variant (p_sku) for it.
- weight_grams drives shipping at checkout: carts with any weighted product require a delivery address and get carrier options from the shipping_rates weight bands.
- Use manage_inventory for stock levels.`,

### What
Manages product variants — attribute combinations (size, color, material) with their own SKU, price delta and stock.
### When to use

- Generating all combinations: action=generate with p_attributes [{"name":"Color","values":["Red","Blue"]},{"name":"Size","values":["S","M","L"]}] creates the cartesian set with auto SKUs
### Parameters
- **p_action**: Required. list, get, create, update, deactivate, generate.
- **p_price_delta_cents**: difference vs product base price (0 = same price).
### Edge cases
- generate is idempotent: existing identical value-combinations are skipped.
- Variant price = product price_cents + price_delta_cents.
- Deactivate instead of delete to preserve order history.`,

### What
Manages product inventory: list stock levels, update quantities, check low-stock alerts.
### When to use
- Admin asks about stock levels
- Automated low-stock alerts
- After order fulfillment
### Parameters
- **action**: Required. list_stock, update_stock, low_stock_alerts, back_in_stock_requests.
- **product_id**: For update_stock.
- **quantity**: New stock quantity. ABSOLUTE, not a delta.
- **threshold**: Low stock threshold (default 5).
- **reason**: Why the correction is being made — lands on the adjustment stock_move.
### Edge cases
- low_stock_alerts returns every tracked, active product at or below its threshold (default 5). The legacy name \`low_stock\` still works as an alias.
- back_in_stock_requests lists un-notified customer waitlist rows.
- update_stock writes an adjustment stock_move for the difference, so a corrected balance always says who moved it and why. Pass **reason**; the fallback is 'manual adjustment via agent'.
- Stock goes negative only for products with allow_backorder — otherwise an order line above the on-hand quantity is refused outright.`,

    instructions: `## manage_orders
### What
Manages e-commerce orders: list, get details, update either status axis, timeline, stats.
### The two axes (this is the thing to get right)
An order answers two independent questions and they live in two columns:
- **Money — orders.status**: pending → paid → (refunded / cancelled / failed / completed)
- **Goods — orders.fulfillment_status**: unfulfilled → picked → packed → shipped → delivered
The VALUE you pass picks the axis. \`status: "delivered"\` moves fulfillment and leaves
\`paid\` alone; \`status: "paid"\` moves the money axis and leaves the shipment alone.
Fulfillment values also stamp picked_at / packed_at / shipped_at / delivered_at.
An unknown value is rejected with the valid list for each axis — do not retry it on the other axis.
### When to use
- Admin asks about orders or order status
- Order fulfillment workflow (ship / deliver, with tracking)
- Business reporting (order stats)
### Parameters
- **action**: Required. list, get, update_status, timeline, stats.
- **order_id**: For get/update_status/timeline.
- **status** or **fulfillment_status**: The new value (see the axes above).
- **tracking_number** / **tracking_url** / **fulfillment_notes**: Written on the same update_status call.
- **period**: For stats: today, week, month, quarter.
### Edge cases
- Verbs work as actions: ship, deliver, fulfill (→ shipped), pay, cancel, refund.
- \`list\` with a fulfillment value filters the fulfillment column, not the payment one.
- stats counts revenue from the MONEY axis only (status paid|completed).
- A full refund driven by an RMA is owned by refund_return, not by this skill.`,

    instructions: `## place_order
### What
Places an order as a customer. Accepts snake_case and camelCase. Resolves products server-side by product_id (UUID) or product_name (fuzzy). Computes total cart weight from products.weight_grams (NULL = non-shippable, excluded from sum) and wires shipping when the cart has any weighted product.
### Shipping selection
- If **shipping_rate_id** is provided → validated against shipping_rates (must be active and weight band must cover total weight).
- Otherwise → calls list_shipping_options(total_weight, currency, country) and auto-selects the cheapest option.
- If no options exist → order is created without shipping (graceful degrade).
- Weightless / service carts → no shipping fields written (unchanged).
### Order total
total_cents = Σ(price × qty) + shipping_cost_cents. shipping_cost_cents and shipping_method are written to the order row and returned in the response so the caller can verify the math.
### Parameters
- **customer_email** (required), **customer_name**
- **items[]**: {product_id | product_name, quantity}
- **currency**: default SEK
- **shipping_address**: {name, line1, line2, postal_code, city, country, phone}
- **shipping_rate_id**: UUID from shipping_rates (optional; overrides auto-cheapest)
### Response
Returns order_id, total_cents, total_weight_grams, shipping_method, shipping_cost_cents.`,

- **p_type/p_value**: percent → p_value is a whole percent (10 = 10%); fixed → p_value is cents (5000 = 50.00) and p_currency is required.
- **p_max_uses / p_min_order_cents / p_valid_from / p_valid_until**: optional constraints, all enforced server-side at checkout.
### Edge cases
- Codes are case-insensitive and unique (SUMMER10 == summer10).
- use_count increments automatically when an order with the code is placed (sandbox) or paid (Stripe webhook) — never set it manually.
- Deactivate instead of delete so use history stays intact.`,
