/**
 * export_site_template is where "save the live site as a template" lives.
 *
 * The gap Magnus named: templates had import and export, but the export landed
 * nowhere — an agent that had just built a site over MCP would have had to
 * transcribe its own work back through manage_site_template by hand. save_as
 * closes that here rather than adding a second verb elsewhere: three other
 * skill descriptions already point at THIS name for "export the current site",
 * and a surface with two words for one job grows two half-working generations.
 *
 * The behaviour rules live in the description, not only the instructions — the
 * description is the tier an agent reads BEFORE choosing the call.

  'Read the live site back as a reusable StarterTemplate — published pages with their blocks, blog posts, branding/header/footer/SEO/cookie settings, homepage slug and enabled modules — and optionally SAVE it: pass save_as=<name> to store it in site_templates (idempotent on the name), so install_template reproduces this site on another instance. Without save_as nothing is written. include=[pages,blog,kb,products] controls what is carried; whatever exists on the site but is not included is listed in export_report.skipped with the flag that would include it, so an omitted section never reads as an empty one. By default it STRIPS the fields that identify the origin instance (organisation name, agent prompts, SEO title, contact details, endpoints) — pass strip_identity=false to keep them; identity.stripped names every removal and identity.possible_secrets scans what remains for credential-shaped strings. export_report.assets counts the ABSOLUTE image URLs — those are referenced, not copied, and keep resolving to this instance after the template is installed elsewhere.

    instructions: `THE SITE COMPOSITION GUIDE — FlowWink owns the framework; the INSTANCE owns the content.

STEP 0, GATHER CONTEXT FIRST (never compose from a blank page):
1. \`manage_site_template action=list\` and \`list_templates\` — the existing templates ARE the house style; mirror their page set, section rhythm and voice.
2. \`describe_blocks\` — the block vocabulary with exact field names. Never guess a field name from an example; a wrong key is silently dropped and the section renders empty.
3. \`search_kb\` / \`search_wiki\` for the instance's positioning, tone and product language.
The platform supplies structure; the instance's own material supplies the words. Do not invent claims, customer names, metrics or logos — placeholder copy that reads as placeholder beats fabricated proof.

THE BODY: \`template_json\` is a StarterTemplate — \`{ pages[], blogPosts[], branding, chatSettings, headerSettings, footerSettings, seoSettings, siteSettings{homepageSlug}, requiredModules[] }\`. Each page is \`{ title, slug, isHomePage?, blocks[], meta{}, menu_order?, showInMenu? }\`. Each block is \`{ type, data{} }\` where \`data\` matches that block type exactly.

RICH TEXT: fields typed \`tiptap\` MUST be JSON objects — \`{"type":"doc","content":[{"type":"paragraph","content":[{"type":"text","text":"…"}]}]}\` — never strings. A stringified doc renders as nothing and looks correct in the payload; \`create\` refuses it and names the field.

PAGE RECIPES (a starting rhythm, not a rule):
- **home**: hero → features or bento-grid → two-column story → social proof (testimonials / logos / stats) → CTA.
- **services/products**: hero → pricing or comparison → accordion (objections) → CTA.
- **about**: two-column story → timeline → team → CTA.
- **contact**: contact or form → map, and nothing else competing for the eye.
- **support/help**: ai-faq or accordion → quick-links → chat-launcher.

COMPOSITION:
- Use the blocks' full range. A page written with only title+content looks like the poor cousin of what the renderer can do. \`two-column\` is the most underused: \`eyebrow\` + \`eyebrowColor\`, \`titleSize\` (default | large | display), \`accentText\` with \`accentPosition\`, \`imageAspect\` / \`imageFit\` / \`imageRounded\`, \`secondImageSrc\`, \`stickyColumn\`, \`ctaText\`/\`ctaUrl\` with \`note\`.
- Alternate eyebrows across sections instead of repeating H2-only headers. At most one \`accentText\` per page — it is seasoning, not sauce.
- Every page needs one clear next action. Two CTAs competing on the same screen is none.
- \`features\` requires an \`icon\` on every item (PascalCase Lucide names).
- Full-bleed blocks (hero, parallax-section, marquee, featured-carousel) already span the viewport — do not wrap them in a container-style section.

WHAT BELONGS WHERE: branding, header, footer, SEO and cookie settings are template-level, not page blocks — a logo pasted into a hero is not a header. \`requiredModules\` lists what the template's pages actually need (a booking block needs the booking module); it is a declaration, not a switch.

FROM THE LIVE SITE INSTEAD: if the site already exists — you just built it, or an admin did — do NOT transcribe it into \`template_json\` by hand. \`export_site_template save_as=<name>\` reads it back and stores it in one call. Compose here only when there is no site to read.

MECHANICS: \`create\` is idempotent on name — an existing name returns \`already_existed: true\`; use \`action=update\` to change a body. Every create/update returns \`validation\` — a non-empty \`errors\` list means the write was refused; \`warnings\` are advice worth reading. \`archive\` deactivates; templates are not deleted, because an installed site's provenance points back at them.`,

    instructions: `## What comes back
\`{ template, validation, saved, stats, export_report }\`. The \`template\` object is
a StarterTemplate — the same shape install_template and the admin Import tab
consume — so it re-imports on any FlowWink instance.

## Saving
Without \`save_as\` this is a PREVIEW: nothing is written. With \`save_as\` the
template is stored in \`site_templates\` under that name (existing name → updated,
never duplicated) and \`saved.template_id\` comes back. That is the whole loop:

  build the site (manage_page + create_page_block)
    → export_site_template save_as="Customer starter"
    → install_template template_id="Customer starter" on the next instance

## What it takes, and what it admits it left
Always: published pages with their blocks and meta, branding, chat, header,
footer, SEO, AEO, cookie banner, homepage slug, accounting locale, and the list
of enabled modules as \`requiredModules\`. Optional via \`include\`: \`blog\`
(default on), \`kb\`, \`products\`. Drafts are never included — a template seeds
content, and an unpublished draft has not been approved for anyone to see.

\`export_report.skipped\` lists every section that exists on this site but is not
in the template, with the flag that would include it. Read it before you save: a
template that quietly omits 34 products looks identical to one from a site that
has none.

## The origin instance's identity
Settings are not design: they say who this is. \`strip_identity\` (default TRUE)
removes organisation name, brand tagline, logo, the agent's system prompt and
welcome message, SEO title and template, contact email/phone/address, and any
configured endpoints. \`identity.stripped\` names every removal with its reason.

This is not cosmetic. A real export carried
\`chatSettings.welcomeMessage: "…sign in (demo@flowwink.com / demo1234)…"\` —
installed on a customer, their chat widget would have greeted visitors with
somebody else's login.

Pass \`strip_identity: false\` only when cloning your own site to a second
instance of the SAME organisation.

\`identity.possible_secrets\` runs either way, over whatever survived, and flags
credential-shaped strings with the value redacted. The named list of identity
fields will always be incomplete — settings gain fields — so the scan is the
half that keeps working. It reports and never deletes: a false positive that
removed real content would be worse than the leak.

\`identity.broken_nav_targets\` lists navigation entries pointing at pages the
template does not contain.

## The images
\`export_report.assets\` counts the ABSOLUTE image URLs in the body and groups them
by host. Those URLs are not copied — installed elsewhere they keep resolving to
their current host, and break the day it goes away. A template whose pictures
point home is a mirror, not a template. Copy the files into the target
instance's storage when the new site has to stand alone.

## Validation
\`validation\` comes from the same database function the write enforces, so a
preview can never disagree with a refusal. A non-empty \`errors\` list means a
\`save_as\` call WOULD BE or WAS refused; \`warnings\` are advice.`,
