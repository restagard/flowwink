### What
Adds a new lead to the CRM system.
### When to use
- Visitor provides contact info in chat
- Form submission contains a new email
- Manual lead entry requested by admin
- NOT for updating existing leads (use manage_leads)
### Parameters
- **email**: Required. Must be a valid email address.
- **name**: Optional but recommended for personalization.
- **phone**: Optional.
- **source**: Where the lead came from: 'chat', 'form', 'manual', 'import'.
### Edge cases
- Duplicate emails: handler may reject or merge — check response.
- Always set source accurately for attribution tracking.`,

    instructions: `## summarize_contact_state
### What
Distils one contact's whole activity ledger into the standing answer to "where
do we stand right now", written into leads.ai_summary. The ledger is the
history; this is the balance.

### When to use
- New activities have been logged since the summary was written
- A salesperson asks about a contact they have not touched in a while
- Scheduled refresh (call without leadId to sweep)

### Parameters
- **leadId**: optional. Omit to sweep stale summaries (bounded, default 10).
- **limit**: sweep only, max 25.

### What it guarantees
- Grounded ONLY in logged entries — it never invents a situation or a next step.
- Replaces the previous summary; history stays in the ledger.
- Stores its own basis (ai_summary_basis: entries, through, model). A sales
  ledger is never complete — conversations happen off-platform — so the surface
  shows what the summary rests on.
- Empty ledger returns {skipped}, never a fabricated paragraph.

### Chain
manage_lead_activity (log what happened) then summarize_contact_state (refresh
the picture), then qualify_lead (score) if the status may have changed.`,

### What
Deterministic lead scoring based on activity points with recency bonus. No AI — just data.

### When to use
- New lead enters the CRM (automation on lead.created signal)
- Admin asks to evaluate/score a lead
- Before creating a deal from a lead
### Parameters
- **leadId**: Required. The lead UUID to qualify.
### What it returns
- score (number), engagement_level (hot/warm/cold), activity_count, recent_activity_count
### Chain suggestion
- After scoring, FlowPilot can reason about the result and update lead status via manage_leads.`,

### What
Enriches a company record with industry, size, website info via domain scraping and AI analysis.
### When to use
- New company created in CRM with only a name/domain
- Admin asks to research a company
- Part of prospect_research pipeline
### Parameters
- **companyId**: Company UUID from the database.
- **domain**: Company domain (e.g., acme.com). Used for scraping.
### Edge cases
- Requires either companyId or domain. Both is ideal.

    instructions: `## manage_leads
### What
Full lead management: list, get, update status/score, delete.
### When to use
- Admin asks to view or manage CRM leads
- Updating lead status in a sales pipeline
- Bulk operations on leads
### Parameters
- **action**: Required. list, get, update, delete.
- **lead_id**: For get/update/delete.
- **status**: Filter (list) or set (update).
- **score**: Set lead score (update).
- **search**: Text search across name/email.
- **lost_reason** / **lost_note**: Pass together with status=lost to record WHY (Odoo lost discipline). lost_reason is one of price, timing, competitor, no_response, other; lost_note is free text.
### Edge cases
- Use add_lead to CREATE new leads. This skill manages EXISTING leads.
- Delete is permanent. Consider archiving instead — setting status=lost with a lost_reason keeps history and feeds win-rate reporting.
- Status is normalized to the pipeline's canonical stages: setting status to "qualified" persists as "opportunity" (synonyms map to the nearest canonical stage). The update succeeds — re-read the lead to see the canonical value; this is expected, not a failure.
- Re-opening a lost lead (setting any non-lost status) automatically clears lost_reason and lost_note.`,

    instructions: `## crm_task_update
### What
Updates an existing CRM task — change title, priority, due date, or mark as completed.
### When to use
- Admin updates task details
- Marking tasks as complete
- Changing task priority
### Parameters
- **id**: Required. Task UUID.
- **completed_at**: ISO timestamp to mark complete. Set to null to reopen.
- **completion_note**: Optional, with completed_at — a short note on the outcome. It is stored on the task AND posted to the lead's timeline (type task_completed), so ALWAYS include one when you finish work: it is how the human verifies what you did.
- **priority**, **title**, **description**, **due_date**: Fields to update.
### Edge cases
- Setting completed_at marks the task as done.
- Setting completed_at to null reopens the task (completion_note is cleared).
- After completing a task, schedule the NEXT follow-up with crm_task_create so the record never sits without a next step.`,

When asked to monitor a competitor:
1. Use browser_fetch or search_web to gather their latest content
2. Analyze their website structure, blog topics, messaging, and product positioning
3. Compare with our own content strategy and identify gaps/opportunities
4. Store findings in agent_memory under category "context" with key "competitor:[domain]"
5. If patterns emerge across multiple scans, update the weekly digest

### Output format
Return a structured analysis with: company_name, domain, recent_content (titles/topics), positioning_summary, our_gaps, opportunities`,

Use this to find email addresses and contact information for people at a company.

### Actions
- **domain_search**: Find all known contacts at a domain. Good for building a contact list.
- **email_finder**: Find a specific person's email by their name + company domain. Good for targeted outreach.

### When to use
- After identifying a prospect company (you need the domain)
- When preparing introduction letters (find the decision maker)
- Lead enrichment: add contacts to existing companies

### Requirements
- Requires HUNTER_API_KEY secret. Will soft-fail without it.
- Extract domain from company URL: "https://www.acme.com/about" → "acme.com"

### Tips
- Always strip "www." from domains
- Check confidence scores: >90 is reliable, <50 is risky
- For domain_search, limit to 10 to conserve API credits`,
