    instructions: `## manage_email_template

### One kind, several languages
\`name\` is the KIND — \`booking_confirmation\`, \`invoice_follow_up\`. \`locale\` is
the version. Together they are the key, so adding German is \`create\` with the
same name and \`locale: "de"\`, not a second kind called
\`booking_confirmation_de\`.

Omitting \`locale\` on create uses the site's default language.

### You do not choose who gets which
The sender resolves it from the recipient's own language — a party carries its
language — using the same ladder as the rest of the platform: exact tag, then
the same language, then the site default, then ANY active version. That last
step is deliberate: an email that does not go out is worse than an email in the
wrong language.

So a missing translation is never an outage. It is a warning in the log and a
message in another language, which the operator can fix by adding the template.

### Editing an existing one
\`list\` shows name and locale together — read it before \`update\`, or you may
edit the Swedish version while meaning the German one. \`update\` takes
\`template_id\`, never name.`,

    instructions: `## send_email
### What
Routes one email through the email-send gateway. Provider comes from site_settings.integrations.email (SMTP or Resend); modules and agents never talk to providers directly.
### When to use
- Ad-hoc or transactional messages to a specific recipient.
### Verify delivery
Check list_communications (channel=email) — status 'sent' means the provider accepted it; 'simulated' means no provider is configured and the message was only logged; 'failed' carries the provider error (see get_communication).
### Edge cases
- Requires approval (trust_level=approve) — outbound mail to arbitrary recipients.
- No provider configured is NOT an error: the send is simulated and logged, so flows keep working (Law 4).
- The gateway associates the recipient with a CRM lead automatically when the email uniquely matches one (outbound_communications trigger).`,

    instructions: `## ingest_inbound_email
### What
Reads the connected company mailbox and writes each message into the
communications log as inbound, bound to the customer it concerns.

### Why it matters
The reply is the half that used to disappear. Sending was recorded; the answer
lived only in a mailbox, invisible to the CRM and to FlowPilot. This closes that
loop, which is why one shared company mailbox beats individual mailboxes: a
reply into a salesperson's own inbox cannot be filed against the customer.

### How a message finds its customer
1. Reply to something we sent → inherits the thread's customer. This is the only
   certain signal, because WE set it when sending.
2. Otherwise the sender address is matched against leads, then company contacts.
3. No match → still stored, and reported under unlinked_senders. An unattached
   message is visible and can be linked later; a dropped one is gone. Never guess.

### Reading the result
- **ingested** — new messages filed
- **skipped_existing** — already known, the expected number on a re-run
- **linked** — of those ingested, how many found a customer
- **unlinked_senders** — addresses worth adding as leads or contacts

diagnostic — the usual cause is an API key that was rotated on Composio's side
