Line total_cents and the PO subtotal/tax/total are computed automatically — do NOT pass them.
CURRENCY: omit \`currency\` and the order takes the vendor's own currency; pass it only to place the order in a different one. \`exchange_rate\` is accounting-currency units per unit of the order currency (EUR→SEK ≈ 11.4) and is stamped from the stored rates for the order date when omitted. A foreign-currency order with no stored rate is REFUSED, not booked at 1 — register the rate first with set_exchange_rate. That rate is what values the goods in stock at receipt, so the order carries it all the way to the books.
VAT: \`tax_rate\` is a PERCENT per line (25 = 25 %). 0 is a real value (EU acquisition / reverse charge) and is respected — the order total is computed from the line rates.
PRICE: pass the vendor's purchase price. resolve_vendor_price gives it, including the quantity tier for the quantity you are ordering. A line priced at the product's SALES price while a cheaper purchase price is on file is refused.
