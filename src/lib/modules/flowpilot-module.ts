    instructions: `## create_objective
### What
Creates a new high-level objective for FlowPilot's autonomous operation.
### When to use
- Admin defines a new business goal
- Heartbeat identifies a gap that needs a structured plan
- System integrity issues require a tracked fix
### Parameters
- **goal**: Required. Clear, measurable goal text.
- **constraints**: Optional guardrails (e.g., no_destructive_actions, deadline, max budget). **Cadence is mandatory for recurring goals** — see below.
- **success_criteria**: Optional measurable criteria for completion.
### Cadence — REQUIRED for any recurring goal
If the goal delivers on a rhythm (a blog post "every day", a digest "each week", "varje dag", "per vecka"), the rhythm MUST live in structured data, not just the goal text. Set:
  constraints.cadence = { "counts": "<skill_name>", "max": <n>, "per": "day" | "week", "every": <k, optional> }
"every" stretches the period: { max: 1, per: "day", every: 3 } = one delivery per rolling three days; { max: 1, per: "week", every: 2 } = one per fortnight. A bare string like "biweekly" is NOT a cadence and binds nothing.
where **counts** is the skill whose successful runs are counted (e.g. write_blog_post) and **max** is how many per period. The heartbeat runs every few hours; a recurring goal WITHOUT cadence fires on every heartbeat and over-produces (a real incident: a "daily" blog objective published ~8 posts/day on a live customer instance). The goal text alone is invisible to the cadence guard.
### Edge cases
- Check existing objectives first to avoid duplicates (query agent_objectives table).
- Objectives drive heartbeat behavior — be specific in goal text.
- Keep active objectives to <5 to maintain focus.`,

    instructions: `## manage_automations
### What
Creates and manages agent automations (cron jobs, event triggers, signal handlers).
### When to use
- Admin asks to automate a recurring task
- Setting up event-driven workflows (e.g., "when a lead is created, qualify it")
- Managing existing automation schedules
### Parameters
- **name**: Required. Automation name.
- **skill_name**: Required. The database skill to execute.
- **trigger_type**: cron, event, signal, manual.
- **trigger_config**: Trigger-specific config (cron expression, event name, etc.).
- **enabled**: Boolean. New automations default to disabled per LAW 7.
### Generative skills are NOT automations
An automation fires its skill with STATIC arguments — there is no reasoning loop on any executor. So a skill that needs model-produced content each run (write_blog_post, generate_content_proposal — anything requiring a \`content\`/\`title\` you must reason out) CANNOT be an automation: a cron fire either errors (missing required args) or republishes frozen text. For recurring generative work create a recurring OBJECTIVE with \`constraints.cadence\` instead (create_objective) — that runs through FlowPilot's loop and produces fresh content. Automations are for deterministic skills (send reminders, sync data, dispatch a signal) whose required args are fully known up front. Incident 2026-07-23: a "daily blog" automation on a live instance errored at 07:00 every day, and another republished one frozen post weekly.
### Edge cases
- skill_name must reference a DATABASE skill, not a built-in tool.
- Cron/manual automations are rejected at create if skill_arguments omits a required parameter of the target skill.
- Cron expressions use standard format: minute hour day month weekday.
- New automations are disabled by default — admin must explicitly enable.`,
