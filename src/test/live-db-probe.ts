/**
 * Global setup: is the live Supabase instance actually reachable?
 *
 * Five test files exercise real RPCs against a live instance — they are the
 * only tests that can prove a SECURITY DEFINER function behaves, so they earn
 * their keep. They already skip when the env vars are absent (CI without a DB).
 *
 * What they did NOT handle is the case that keeps happening: env vars PRESENT,
 * instance DOWN. Then `fetch failed` surfaces as an assertion failure and the
 * suite goes red for a reason that has nothing to do with the code under
 * review. That happened three times on 2026-08-12 alone, the last time
 * blocking a security fix — a red build nobody can act on teaches everyone to
 * ignore red builds.
 *
 * So probe once, before any test runs, and publish the verdict as an env flag
 * the suites can branch on synchronously. Unreachable → those suites report as
 * SKIPPED (with the reason on stdout), never as failed. Reachable → they run
 * exactly as before, and a genuine RPC regression still fails the build.
