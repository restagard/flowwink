 * Helper to create TipTap content.
 *
 * The id is a DETERMINISTIC counter, not `Math.random()`. It used to be random,
 * evaluated at module load — so every run of `templates-to-json.ts` emitted 30
 * different block ids and produced a thirty-line diff that changed nothing.
 * Proven by running the generator twice on an unchanged tree: the only
 * differences were these ids.
 *
 * That noise is not cosmetic. It collides with anyone else editing the same
 * emitted files, and it hides a real change inside a wall of churn — so the
 * next person either commits a diff they cannot explain or misses the one line
 * that mattered.
 *
 * A counter is enough: ids must be unique within a page (BlockRenderer passes
 * block.id to FormBlock / BookingBlock / WebinarBlock to bind submissions to a
 * block), and module evaluation is top-to-bottom, so the sequence is stable
 * across runs. Content-derived ids were the alternative and are worse here —
 * two identical paragraphs would collide.
 *
 * Already-installed sites keep the ids stored in their own database; this
 * changes what NEW installs are seeded with.
