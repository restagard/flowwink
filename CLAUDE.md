## Architecture

FlowWink is a self-hosted Business Operating System (BOS) built on React + Supabase. An autonomous AI operator called FlowPilot runs content, leads, orders, and growth — around the clock. Each deployment is a single-tenant site for one customer.

### Request flow

```
Visitor → PublicPage.tsx → get-page edge function → page.content_json (ContentBlock[])
                         → BlockRenderer.tsx → [Name]Block.tsx (renders each block)

Admin → PageEditorPage.tsx → BlockEditor.tsx → [Name]BlockEditor.tsx (edit each block)
```

Pages are stored in the `pages` table as `content_json: ContentBlock[]`. `PublicPage` fetches via the `get-page` edge function (with DB fallback), then `BlockRenderer` dispatches to the appropriate block component by `block.type`.

### Core Architecture Principle: Blocks are interfaces to FlowPilot

**Blocks have two responsibilities only:**
1. **Intent capture** — structured UI that makes the visitor's intent explicit
2. **Response rendering** — display FlowPilot's answer in a visual format

**FlowPilot is always the intelligence layer.** Blocks never build their own AI pipelines.

```
WRONG:  Block → dedicated edge function → AI model
RIGHT:  Block → FlowPilot (chat-completion) → structured response → Block renders
```

Why: FlowPilot has soul, objectives, knowledge base, CRM context, and full site awareness. A block that bypasses it breaks the "website is a consultant" narrative.

### Auth pattern for public blocks

Public blocks (visible to anonymous visitors) must NOT use `supabase.functions.invoke()` — it sends the user JWT and returns 401 for unauthenticated visitors.

Use the same pattern as `useChat.tsx`:
```ts
const response = await fetch(
  `${import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/chat-completion`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY}`,
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ ... }),
  }
);
```

### Block System

Each block has:
- **Public renderer**: `src/components/public/blocks/[Name]Block.tsx`
- **Admin editor**: `src/components/admin/blocks/[Name]BlockEditor.tsx`
- **Registration in two places**: `BlockRenderer.tsx` (switch dispatch) and `BlockEditor.tsx` (editor dispatch)

Admin editors use the `isEditing` prop:
- `isEditing=false` → visual preview (should look almost identical to public block)
- `isEditing=true` → settings/edit panel

Block layout in `BlockRenderer`: full-bleed blocks (hero, parallax-section, marquee, etc.) skip the container wrapper. All others get `container mx-auto max-w-6xl px-4` and `py-12 md:py-16 lg:py-20` section padding. Backgrounds auto-alternate between `muted/40` and transparent for non-self-styled blocks.

**Block metadata** lives in `src/lib/block-reference.ts` — the canonical registry mapping block types to their schema, preview, and capabilities.

### Module System

FlowWink has 68 modules in `src/lib/modules/`. Each module is a TypeScript file defining:
- Module metadata (id, name, category, dependencies)
- Feature set and capabilities
- Skill registrations pointing to `agent_skills` rows

**Module categories include:** accounting, analytics, approvals, blog, booking, browser-control, calendar, chat, companies, contracts, crm, customer360, deals, docs, documents, email, expenses, federation, field-service, fixed-assets, flowpilot, forms, global-blocks, growth, handbook, hr, inventory, invoicing, kb, live-support, manufacturing, media, multi-currency, newsletter, pages, payroll, pos, pricelists, products, projects, purchasing, quotes, reconciliation, recruitment, consultants, returns, river, sales-intelligence, shipping, site-migration, sla, subscriptions, surveys, templates, tickets, timesheets, webinars, wiki, workspace-chat.

To scaffold a new module: `bun run scripts/new-module.ts`

**Module API contracts** (`src/types/module-contracts.ts`): formal Zod schemas for all cross-module communication. All cross-module data exchange MUST use these contracts.

### Edge Functions

All edge functions live in `supabase/functions/[name]/index.ts` and are Deno-based.

**Core API:**
- `chat-completion` — FlowPilot AI endpoint; supports OpenAI, Gemini, local, n8n providers
- `get-page` — serves pages with caching; called by PublicPage before DB fallback
- `content-api` — programmatic content access

**Agent / FlowPilot:**
- `agent-execute`, `agent-operate`, `agent-reason` — agentic AI workflow functions
- `flowpilot-heartbeat`, `flowpilot-briefing`, `flowpilot-distill`, `flowpilot-learn` — autonomous operator lifecycle
- `mcp-server` — outward-facing MCP gateway for external agents/federation peers

**Automations:**
- `automation-dispatcher`, `event-dispatcher`, `signal-dispatcher`, `signal-ingest` — workflow automation pipeline

**Commerce / Finance:**
- `create-checkout`, `create-invoice-payment`, `send-order-confirmation`, `subscribe` — e-commerce
- `generate-invoice-pdf`, `reconciliation`, `dunning-processor`, `fetch-fx-rates` — finance

**AI Enrichment:**
- `prospect-research`, `contact-finder`, `enrich-company`, `parse-resume`, `extract-pdf-text`, `extract-receipt` — data enrichment
- `web-search`, `web-scrape`, `browser-fetch`, `firecrawl-account` — web intelligence

**Integrations:**
- `stripe-webhook`, `gmail-inbox-scan`, `gmail-oauth-callback`, `composio-proxy`, `hunter-account` — third-party

**Communication:**
- `email-send`, `newsletter-send`, `send-contact-email`, `send-booking-confirmation`, `send-invoice-email` — outbound comms

**System / Admin:**
- `setup-database`, `system-integrity-check`, `test-ai-connection`, `instance-health` — operations
- `run-autonomy-tests`, `run-platform-tests` — autonomous testing

**Shared utilities** live in `supabase/functions/_shared/`:
- `pilot/` — FlowPilot ReAct engine (reason.ts, prompt-compiler.ts, built-in-tools.ts, handlers.ts)
- `skills/intent-scorer.ts` — Skill Relevance Engine (shared between FlowPilot and MCP gateway)
- `mcp/` — MCP schema definitions and connection group config
- `ai-call.ts`, `ai-config.ts`, `ai-providers.ts` — AI provider abstraction
- `token-tracking.ts`, `trace.ts`, `agent-audit.ts` — observability

### The Agent Harness (platform spine)

The components above plus the ReAct loop, Skill Relevance Engine, trust dial, cadence/
evidence guards, self-correcting errors and the Curator together form **the FlowWink Agent
Harness** — the named platform spine that both FlowPilot (internal operator) and external
agents (via the MCP gateway) run on. It is platform-level, NOT a flowpilot-module feature.
When adding agent-reliability behaviour, place it by harness component, not by module. Full
component map, ownership ruling, and the Trace/resumption build plan:
**[docs/architecture/agent-harness.md](docs/architecture/agent-harness.md)**.

### MCP Server (external agent access)

`mcp-server` exposes FlowWink skills to external agents. It runs on Supabase Edge Functions, so the transport is **Streamable HTTP** (not stdio — there is no long-lived local process). This is a consequence of serverless deployment, not Deno.

The system has 500+ skills. Exposing all of them as individual MCP tools floods a client's context. Three connection profiles control what a client sees (all via query params; default = unfiltered, kept for backward compat):

- `?groups=crm,commerce` — specialist: only that category's tools (~8). See `_shared/mcp/groups.ts` and `/rest/groups`.
- `?mode=dispatch` — generalist operator: a **3-tool surface** — `search_skills({query, groups?})` ranks skills by intent (each entry carries `has_instructions`), `read_skill({name})` loads a skill's full instructions/playbook before running it (the same lazy tier FlowPilot has via its built-in `skill_read`), `execute_skill({name, arguments})` runs one. Broad reach, ~3 schemas in context.
- (no param) — all tools exposed.

**Skill relevance is a platform primitive, not a FlowPilot-internal one.** The component is the **Skill Relevance Engine** (`scoreSkillsByIntent` / `loadRecentUsageCounts` in `_shared/skills/intent-scorer.ts`). Name it for what it does (ranks skills by intent), NOT for a transport — it is neither "MCP" nor "FlowPilot" specific. It has **two consumers**:

1. **FlowPilot** (`reason.ts`) — internal, every ReAct turn: narrows 500+ skills → ~25 relevant ones. No MCP involved here; this is a direct in-process call over the DB-loaded skill set. The scorer receives `config.scoringIntent` (e.g. active objectives) concatenated with the last user message — so autonomous loops surface objective-relevant skills, not just meta-tools.
2. **The outward MCP gateway** (`search_skills` in `?mode=dispatch`) — external operators, the same ranking exposed as a tool.

It lives in `_shared/skills/` (NOT under `pilot/`) precisely because the gateway must work for external agents even when the FlowPilot module is disabled. When promoting capability-discovery logic, keep it here. FlowPilot's actual intelligence (soul, objectives, ReAct decisions) stays in FlowPilot; only the "which skill is relevant" lookup is shared. Avoid naming it "Router"/"Selector" — selection is by scoring on metadata, not hardcoded dispatch (Law 1).

**FlowPilot does NOT call its own MCP gateway internally** — it shares the Engine and hits the DB / `executeSkill` directly. Deliberate, not an omission: MCP would add an HTTP hop, auth, and JSON-RPC serialization for zero gain when you're already inside the same Deno process with service-role DB access. MCP is a transport for *crossing a trust/process boundary*; FlowPilot is already on the inside of it.

### REST compatibility layer (`/rest/*`)

The `/rest/execute` endpoint mirrors the MCP tool surface but over plain HTTP POST. It respects `?mode=dispatch` and `?groups=` query params just like the native MCP transport:

- `POST /rest/execute` — call any skill by name: `{ "tool": "browse_blog", "arguments": {} }`
- `POST /rest/execute?mode=dispatch` — exposes `search_skills`, `read_skill` and `execute_skill` as tools:
  - `{ "tool": "search_skills", "arguments": { "query": "create knowledge base article" } }`
  - `{ "tool": "read_skill", "arguments": { "name": "manage_contract_template" } }` — the skill's full instructions (authoring guides, workflow playbooks) before executing
  - `{ "tool": "execute_skill", "arguments": { "name": "browse_blog", "arguments": {} } }`
- `GET /rest/resources/:key` — read resources (requires `Accept: text/event-stream` for `/rest/skills`; use `/rest/resources/briefing` etc. for JSON)
- `GET /rest/groups` — list skill categories and their modules
- `POST /rest/lock/acquire` / `/rest/lock/release` — distributed locking for multi-step ops

**Bug fixed (2026-06-07):** `/rest/execute` previously ignored `?mode=dispatch` and returned "Unknown tool: search_skills". Fixed — dispatch mode now works via both native MCP and REST.

### Skill schema gotchas for external operators

**`manage_kb_article` create** — KB articles are Q&A format. Fields:
- `title` (required) — display title
- `question` (optional, auto-derived from title if omitted: `"What is {title}?"`)
- `answer` / `content` / `body` (required, all accepted as aliases) — full article body
- `category` — string name or slug; auto-creates category if none exist

**`manage_wiki_page` update** — requires `slug` to identify the page. If `slug` is omitted but `title` matches an existing page (case-insensitive), the slug is auto-resolved. Safe pattern: `search_wiki` first to get the slug, then `update`.

**`manage_wiki_page` create** — requires `content_md` (markdown body). Empty bodies are rejected at the handler level to prevent blank pages.

**`manage_company`** — B2B master data lives on `companies`: `org_number`, `vat_number`, `parent_company_id` (subsidiary hierarchy; self-parent rejected), `employee_count`, `annual_revenue_cents`, `credit_limit_cents`, `account_owner`, `tags` (text[]). Use `find_duplicate_companies` before creating a company that might already exist (identical domain scores 1.0).

**`refund_return`** — supports **partial refunds**: each call adds `refund_cents` to the running total; the expected total is Σ(return_items qty × unit_refund_cents) − `restocking_fee_cents`. Over-refunds are rejected. The RMA closes when the total is reached or `p_final: true` is passed. Set the restocking fee via `inspect_return` (QC step, only valid in status `received`).

**`manage_kb_article` get** — accepts `article_id`, `slug` or `title` (NOT `id`). Title resolves case-insensitively (exact, then unique prefix); ambiguous titles error with guidance. Safe pattern for certainty: `list`/search first, then `get` by slug.

**`upload_document`** — binary mode requires `mime_type` alongside `content_base64`; text mode uses `content_text`.

**`update_company_profile`** — Business Identity is what a page-authoring agent
reads before it emits blocks, so its structured fields carry BOTH halves a block
needs: `services` and `differentiators` are `[{name, description}]` (a features
block needs the description; a bare label means the generator writes one
itself), `proof_points` are `[{value, label, context}]` with the figure printed
verbatim in `value` ("412 km", "99,98 %"), `client_testimonials` are
`[{quote, author, role, company}]` one entry per quote, and `primary_cta` is
`{label, destination, intent}` — without a label there is no CTA and a generated
page ends with no ask. Legacy shapes (`differentiators: string[]`, a single
testimonial blob) are migrated on read and coerced on write, never rejected.
Keep metrics OUT of `delivered_value` prose alone: parsing a number back out of
a sentence is where a model invents one. Leave an attribution or a description
empty rather than guessing it — an omission is correctable, an invention is not.

### Template System

Templates live in `src/data/templates/` as TypeScript, registered in `index.ts → ALL_TEMPLATES`.

**Available templates:**
- `flowwink-platform` — complete platform demo with all modules (94KB)
- `consult-agency` — consulting agency
- `securehealth` — healthcare compliance
- `launchpad` — startup/SaaS landing page
- `flowwink-agency` — marketing agency
- `digital-shop` — e-commerce
- `service-pro` — service provider
- `trustcorp` — financial services
- `demo-company` — general company demo
- `momentum` — minimal startup
- `helpcenter` — support/KB-focused
- `blank` — empty template

When a template is installed (`NewSitePage`), it seeds:
- Pages, blog posts, KB articles, products, consultant profiles
- FlowPilot soul + objectives → `agent_objectives` table via `setup-flowpilot` edge function

To add a new template:
1. Create `src/data/templates/my-template.ts`
2. Export and add to `ALL_TEMPLATES` in `index.ts`
3. Run `bun run scripts/templates-to-json.ts`

### Key conventions

- **Path alias**: `@/` maps to `src/`. Use it for all imports.
- **Logging**: Use `logger` from `@/lib/logger` (not `console.*`). Logs are suppressed in production except `logger.error`.
- **Styling**: Tailwind with design tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, `border-border`). Never use raw colors.
- **State**: TanStack Query for server state; React state for local UI state.
- **Forms**: react-hook-form + zod validation.
- **UI components**: shadcn/ui in `src/components/ui/` — prefer these over custom implementations.
- **Module contracts**: All cross-module data exchange uses the Zod schemas in `src/types/module-contracts.ts`.
- **Tiptap editors**: Always use the shared `<AITiptapToolbar>` component — never build per-block AI toolbar variants.

## Database Migrations

All migrations MUST be idempotent (safe to run multiple times). Use `IF NOT EXISTS`, `CREATE OR REPLACE`, and `DROP ... IF EXISTS` patterns. See `docs/contributing/contributing.md` for detailed SQL patterns.

Migrations are timestamped UUID filenames: `YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_<uuid>.sql`.

**Squashing migrations destroys seed data — extract it first.** The 2026-06-08
baseline squash (453 files → one schema baseline) kept all DDL and silently
dropped every seed `INSERT`. `role_module_access_defaults` had been seeded in an
April migration; after the squash, every fresh install was born with empty role
tables, so role views showed only ungated nav items — and nobody noticed for two
months because every live instance predated the squash and a July feature
(RolePreviewSwitcher) was built on top of data that was already gone from the
repo. Rules that follow:
1. Before any squash: `grep -l "INSERT INTO"` across the files being removed,
   and move platform-config seeds into their own forward-dated idempotent
   migrations FIRST (see `20260804150000_seed-role-module-access-defaults.sql`
   for the pattern — defaults upserted, live table filled only when empty so
   operator customisations survive).
2. After any squash or consolidation: run one install from scratch. "Works on
   dev" is the weakest possible evidence — dev has accreted since April and can
   never fail the fresh-install test.
3. Distinguish platform config (nav/role behaviour — MUST be seeded) from
   business config (carriers, booking services, approval rules — born empty is
   correct; a new org defines its own).

```bash
# Push migrations to a Supabase project
supabase db push --project-ref <ref>
```

## Deployment

> **Manifest discipline:** any commit touching `supabase/migrations/` or
> `supabase/seed/` must regenerate `supabase/seed/instance-manifest.json`
> (`npm run manifest:json`) — CI's freshness guardrail fails otherwise.
> A pre-commit hook in `.githooks/` does this automatically; enable it with
> `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` after cloning.


Frontend (Vercel/Easypanel) auto-deploys from GitHub push.

Manual steps per Supabase project after migrations or new edge functions:
```bash
supabase db push --project-ref <ref>
supabase functions deploy <function-name> --no-verify-jwt --project-ref <ref>
# Sync skill metadata from code → agent_skills (prevents drift; see below)
DATABASE_URL='postgresql://postgres:<pw>@db.<ref>.supabase.co:5432/postgres' npm run sync:skills -- --apply
```

Public-facing edge functions must be deployed with `--no-verify-jwt`.
Admin-only functions can use default JWT verification.

**A "site" is four layers** (schema via migrations, **skills via bootstrap**,
edge functions via deploy, frontend via Vercel) and they drift if not synced
together. `agent_skills` rows come from `skillSeeds` in `src/lib/modules/*` via
bootstrap — **not** migrations — so running migrations never refreshes skills.
Regenerate the artifact (`npm run skills:json`) and sync each instance
(`npm run sync:skills` dry-run, `-- --apply` to write). Full runbook, the live
fleet's refs, and fork vs. auto-deploy topology:
**[docs/operators/provisioning-and-updates.md](docs/operators/provisioning-and-updates.md)**.
NB: fork auto-deploy varies — VERIFY, don't assume: autoversio.ai and optictunnels.se
auto-deploy BOTH Vercel and Supabase (migrations + edge functions) on a fork push
(verified 2026-08-31: deployed sha == fork main). The layer NO fork rail covers is
skills — run `DATABASE_URL=… npm run sync:skills -- --apply` per fork, or the
admin "Sync skills from code" button.

### Drift & agent-usability learnings (operational)

Hard-won notes from reconciling the Lovable-managed dev instance and making the
MCP skill surface usable by an autonomous operator (OpenClaw):

- **Forward-date migrations for managed instances.** Lovable's migrate runner
  applies migrations from its own `supabase_migrations` ledger; a repo migration
  whose timestamp is **below the ledger HEAD is silently skipped**. Anything that
  must reach a managed/forked instance has to be forward-dated (timestamp ≥ now)
  and idempotent (`CREATE OR REPLACE`). This caused real gaps: missing functions,
  a missing `refund_return(...,p_final)` overload, and an entire class of admin
  functions stuck on pre-patch bodies.
- **Name-only existence checks miss body/signature drift.** `pg_proc` by name
  says a function exists, not that its body is current or that an overload is
  present. Verify behavior (live call) or the specific signature, not just the name.
- **Agent-callable SECURITY DEFINER functions need the service_role escape.** The
  MCP gateway runs RPC skills with the service key, so inside the function
  `auth.uid()` is NULL and `has_role(auth.uid(),'admin')` is false. Guard with
  `(auth.role() = 'service_role' OR has_role(auth.uid(), <role>))` or the operator
  gets "Only admins…". 44 admin functions had this patch stranded in skipped
  backdated migrations.
- **"Sync skills from code" is the 4th-layer deploy without DB creds.**
  `/admin/modules` → **"Sync skills from code"** re-runs `bootstrapModule()` for
  every enabled module, which **UPDATEs all definition fields** (handler,
  instructions, description, tool_definition, …) on existing `agent_skills` rows
  from the bundled seeds — runs as the admin login, no `DATABASE_URL` needed.
  Use it after a frontend deploy when migrations/edge deploys didn't refresh
  skills (e.g. a handler changed `db:` → `ai-task:`). It does NOT touch
  `trust_level`, so runtime trust overrides survive a resync.
- **Self-correcting RPC errors.** `agent-execute` enriches a PostgREST PGRST202
  ("function not found in schema cache" — the signature of wrong param NAMES)
  with the params the agent sent and the skill's declared parameters, so an
  operator that guesses (e.g. `p_payment_method` instead of `p_method`)
  self-corrects next turn. When adding RPC skills, keep `tool_definition`
  parameter names exactly matching the function so this hint is accurate.
- **Skill instructions are the agent-context lever.** Most autonomous-operator
  failures are context failures, not platform bugs (guessing `quantity` vs `qty`,
  `vendor_name` vs a `vendor_id` UUID, missing the staged-op handshake). Bake the
  exact param/field names and non-obvious workflow (e.g. staged
  `approve_pending_operation` → re-invoke with `_approved_operation_id`) into the
  skill's `instructions`. `instructions` is optional — ~27% of skills rely on a
  good `description` alone, which is valid per Law 2.
- **QA findings live on the gateway, not just the DB.** `scan_beta_findings`
  lists open `beta_test_findings`; `resolve_finding({finding_id, resolution_note})`
  closes them — both callable via the FlowWink gateway with no Lovable/DB access.
  Validate before closing: agent QA reports are frequently false positives (wrong
  arg names read as "missing function/column"). Only a live call or `pg_proc` is
  authoritative.

## Naming & skill-homing policy (FlowWink vs FlowPilot)

**FlowWink is the platform (the BOS/SaaS). FlowPilot is one module** — the
autonomous operator that consumes the platform's skills. Consequences:

- **Platform primitives must NOT live in flowpilot-module.** A skill used
  across modules or by external operators (search_web, scrape_url,
  manage_site_settings, run_daily_briefing, weekly_business_digest…) belongs
  in `src/lib/platform-seeds.ts` (always seeded, module-toggle-independent —
  emitted as pseudo-module `platform` in the skills artifact) or in the owning
  domain module — never gated behind the FlowPilot toggle. This class caused
  real drift twice (weekly_business_digest, the platform-seeds move).
- **Name new platform components for what they do, not for FlowPilot**
  (same rule as the Skill Relevance Engine note above).
- **Runtime identifiers stay stable even where legacy-named.** Edge function
  names (`flowpilot-heartbeat`, `flowpilot-learn`), DB values
  (`flowpilot_to_openclaw`), cron jobnames, and `agent_type` strings are
  deployed per-instance across the fleet — renaming them is a multi-instance
  lockstep with zero user value. Fix the STORY (docs/UI copy), not the wire.

## FlowPilot Development Laws

These are inviolable architectural laws for FlowPilot agent development:

### Law 1: No Hardcoded Intent Detection

**NEVER add regex patterns, keyword lists, or if-statements to route specific user intents to specific skills.** FlowPilot MUST select skills through its general reasoning engine (ReAct loop + scoring algorithm) based on skill metadata alone.

- ❌ `if (/migrate|import/.test(msg)) forcePick('migrate_url')`
- ✅ Improve skill `description` with clear `Use when:` / `NOT for:` markers so the scoring algorithm naturally ranks it

**Why:** Hardcoded routing creates an unmaintainable web of special cases that prevents true autonomy. Every new capability would require a new if-statement instead of just registering a skill.

### Law 2: Skills Are Self-Describing

Every skill MUST contain sufficient metadata (`description`, `Use when:`, `NOT for:`) for the general scoring algorithm to select it correctly. If a skill isn't being picked up, the fix is ALWAYS better metadata — never a routing hack.

Use `bun run scripts/skill-linter.ts` to validate skill metadata quality.

### Law 3: Blocks Are Interfaces, Not Pipelines

Blocks capture intent and render responses. They NEVER build their own AI pipelines. All intelligence flows through FlowPilot's reasoning engine. See "Core Architecture Principle" above.

**Refinement — Utility vs Skill:** Pure text transforms (improve / translate / summarize / expand / continue) on a text selection are **utilities**, not pipelines. They call `chat-completion` directly via `useAITextGeneration` and require no platform context. Use the shared `<AITiptapToolbar>` component in every Tiptap editor for consistency. Anything that needs business context (KB, identity, past records, policy) is a **skill** — register it in `agent_skills` and execute via FlowPilot or `agent-execute`.

### Guard design: discover, don't enumerate

A guard that checks an ALLOWLIST of known files protects only what someone
already thought of — the week of 2026-08-25 produced a dozen "one more English
string" fixes past guards that were all green, because each guard enumerated
the surfaces it knew (four files for `operatorText`, two regex shapes for
hardcoded text). Prefer guards that SCAN everything and ratchet a count
(`no-new-hardcoded-visitor-text`: the number may only shrink), and when a new
bug class appears, teach the scanner the SHAPE (e.g. `field || 'English'`) rather
than adding the file that bit you. One fact, one reader: two settings that both
answer "what language is this site" (`site_languages` vs `platform_locale`) is
how a whole instance inverted (#430) — read the declared one, everywhere.

### Law 4: Fail Forward, Don't Gate

Prefer runtime fallbacks over static validation gates. If API keys exist, the feature works — don't require manual `enabled` flags on top of working credentials.

## Agent coordination (Claude Code ↔ Lovable / OpenClaw)

> The old Agent Bridge on `clawstack.froste.eu` is **decommissioned** — do not use it.

**Lovable dev sandbox** — dev.flowwink.com is the primary development environment, reached via the
**Lovable MCP** (mcp.lovable.dev): project `fac5f9b2-2dc8-4cce-be0a-4266a826f893` ("flowwink") in
workspace `oBEHQe55t4gxaILuzdAd`. Useful tools:

- `send_message` — task Lovable's agent in natural language (**consumes workspace credits**)
- `query_database` — SQL against the dev backend (`rzhjotxffjfsdlhrdkpj`); prefer SELECT
- `get_diff`, `list_files`, `read_file`, `list_messages` — inspect code and agent history

**OpenClaw** — the external MCP operator runs at `https://openclaw.liteit.se`
(health: `GET /health` → `{"ok":true,"status":"live"}`). It operates FlowWink instances through the
outward MCP gateway (`mcp-server`, `?mode=dispatch`).
