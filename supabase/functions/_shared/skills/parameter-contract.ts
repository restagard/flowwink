/**
 * The skill-parameter contract bounce, in one place.
 *
 * A guard that names a mistake without naming the fix is a dead end, and a
 * model in a loop answers a dead end by looking for another door. Verified in
 * agent_activity on a live instance (2026-08-22):
 *
 *   19:40:44  manage_page           failed  → "[preflight-bounce] unknown parameter(s) is_published"
 *   19:41:21  landing_page_compose  success → a page of four bare text blocks
 *
 * The model had guessed `is_published` (a reasonable guess — manage_docs_page
 * and manage_kb_article really do take it). The preflight was RIGHT to bounce:
 * manage_page's schema has no such parameter and its handler never reads one;
 * publication there is `action: "publish"`. But the message only said the name
 * was unknown. Thirty-seven seconds later the model had abandoned the good
 * skill for a weaker one and built a worse page.
 *
 * So the bounce carries its own remedy: the unknown name, the nearest valid
 * one (computed, never a hardcoded pair — Law 1), the full valid list, and a
 * pointer to the skill's instructions when it has any. Same voice as the block
 * field guard, which already works this way.
