# System Settings

`/admin/settings` is the single panel for **site-wide configuration**. Every value here is stored in the `site_settings` table (one row per `key`) and is editable by administrators. Module-specific settings live on each module's own page (e.g. `/admin/chat`, `/admin/accounting`).

> **Scope:** site-wide, single-tenant. Each FlowWink deployment has its own `site_settings` row set.

## 1. General

| Field | Default | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Homepage slug** | `home` | Slug of the page rendered at `/`. Keep `home` unless you've created a custom landing page. |
| **Content review enabled** | `false` | Turn ON in regulated industries — forces draft → approval before any blog/page goes live. |

### Customer Portal (sub-section)

Controls **end-customer** self-registration (separate from staff signup, which is governed by the global Supabase flag `auth.disable_signup`).

| Field | Default | When to change |
|---|---|---|
| **Portal enabled** | `true` | OFF for internal-only sites (no `/account` area at all). |
| **Allow self-signup** | `true` | OFF if all customer accounts are created manually or via integration. |
| **Require email verification** | `true` | Keep ON in production. Only turn off for closed pilots. |
| **Guest checkout** | `true` | E-commerce only. OFF forces account creation before paying. |

> **Why separate from staff signup?** A self-hosted instance often disables general signup (`auth.disable_signup=true`) to lock down admin access, but still wants customers to register through e-commerce or bookings. The `customer-signup` edge function bypasses the global flag using the service role and respects the policy above. See `mem://architecture/platform-modules-operators-layering`.

## 2. System AI

The **AI map**: the one place models are chosen. Every AI surface — the Tiptap toolbar, enrichment, lead qualification, summaries, FlowPilot's responder for chat and email — resolves its provider and model through `resolveAiConfig()` from this map. A surface never picks a model of its own.

| Field | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Provider** | `openai` for highest quality, `gemini` for lowest cost, `anthropic`, or `local` for air-gapped (Ollama / LM Studio). Only providers with a key or endpoint are selectable. |
| **Chat & Interaction Model** (per provider) | Cheap & fast (e.g. `gpt-4.1-mini`, `gemini-2.5-flash`). The *fast* tier — chat, tools, bulk tasks. |
| **Research & Reasoning Model** (per provider) | More capable (e.g. `gpt-4.1`, `gemini-2.5-pro`). The *reasoning* tier — enrichment, classification, planning. |
| **Default Tone** | Matches your brand voice. Used as fallback when blocks/skills don't specify. |
| **Default Language** | ISO-639-1 (`en`, `sv`, `de`, …). |

Models are stored per provider (`openaiModel` / `openaiReasoningModel`, `geminiModel` / …), so switching provider keeps each provider's own choices. A *multimodal* request (image / PDF input) falls through to the first vision-capable provider with a key when the chosen one has none.

**One surface may pin a provider: the public chat.** Under **AI Chat → Provider → Provider for this chat** the options are *Follow the platform AI* (default) or a cloud provider that has a key. A pin changes the provider only — the models are still this map's for that provider. The case it exists for: the system AI runs on a private endpoint (FlowWork, FlowPilot, all business data) while the visitor chat may answer from a cloud model, or the reverse.

> API keys are **never** stored here. Add them in `/admin/integrations` (or as Supabase secrets `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`). If the key is missing, AI features degrade gracefully — see `mem://ui/graceful-degradation-and-upsell-pattern`.

## 3. SEO

Controls `<title>`, meta description, OG/Twitter cards, and crawler directives.

| Field | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| **Site title** | Brand name. Becomes the homepage `<title>` and fallback. |
| **Title template** | Use `%s | Brand` to suffix every page title. `%s` is the page-specific title. |
| **Default description** | <160 chars. Shown when a page has no own description. |
| **OG image** | 1200×630 PNG/JPG. Used for social sharing previews. |
| **Twitter handle** | `@yourbrand`. |
| **Google site verification** | Token from Google Search Console (HTML-meta-tag method). |
| **Index / Follow** | Both ON in production. OFF on staging or hidden environments. |
| **Development mode** | ON during pre-launch — forces `noindex,nofollow` regardless of page-level settings. |
| **Require auth in dev mode** | ON in pre-launch — blocks anonymous visitors entirely. |

**Best practice:** keep `Development mode = ON` until DNS cutover, then flip it OFF in one move so search engines don't index the staging URL.

---

## 4. AEO (Answer Engine Optimization)

Makes your site readable by LLM crawlers (ChatGPT browsing, Perplexity, Claude, Gemini) and rich-result engines.

| Section | What it produces |
|---|---|
| **Organization metadata** | `name`, `description`, `contactEmail`, `primaryLanguage`, social profiles, business hours — emitted as `schema.org/Organization` JSON-LD on every page. |
| **`llms.txt`** | Served at `/llms.txt` — short list of canonical pages for LLM crawlers. ON in production. |
| **`llms-full.txt`** | Served at `/llms-full.txt` — full content concatenation. Set `maxWordsPerPage` to cap size (~2000). |
| **schema.org type** | `Organization`, `LocalBusiness`, `ProfessionalService`, etc. Pick the most specific that applies. |
| **FAQ / Article schema** | Auto-injected on FAQ blocks and blog posts. Keep ON. |
| **Sitemap** | Served at `/sitemap.xml`. `changefreq=weekly`, `priority=0.5` are sane defaults; raise priority on key landing pages individually. |

**Best practice:** AEO Enabled = ON in production. The hit is small (one JSON-LD block + 2 text files) and the upside for LLM-driven discovery is large.

---

## 5. Maintenance

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | When ON, public site shows the maintenance page; `/admin` remains accessible. |
| **Title / Message** | What visitors see. Keep it short and human. |
| **Expected end time** | Optional ISO timestamp. Rendered as a countdown. |

**Best practice:** turn ON before destructive migrations, then OFF immediately after smoke-testing.

---

## 6. Custom Scripts

Inject raw HTML/JS at four slots: `head start`, `head end`, `body start`, `body end`.

| Use case | Slot |
|---|---|
| Plausible / Fathom / GA tag | `head end` |
| Meta Pixel base code | `head end` |
| Crisp / Intercom widget | `body end` |
| A/B-testing snippet (must run before paint) | `head start` |

**HTML5 constraint:** never put `<noscript><img/></noscript>` (pixel fallbacks) in `<head>`. Use `body start` instead — see project rules.

**Security:** anything you paste here runs with full page privileges. Only paste code you trust.

---

## 7. Cookies

Copy and behavior of the consent banner.

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Enabled** | ON in EU markets, OFF for purely internal tools. |
| **Title / Description** | GDPR-compliant copy. Keep it short. |
| **Policy link** | Must point to a real `/privacy-policy` page. |
| **Accept / Reject buttons** | Reject must be equally prominent — GDPR requirement. |

The banner controls whether **non-essential** scripts (analytics, pixels) load. Essential scripts always run.

---

## 8. Performance

| Field | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Lazy load images** | ON | Keep ON. Native `loading="lazy"`. |
| **Prefetch links** | ON | Prefetches in-viewport links on hover. Negligible cost. |
| **Minify HTML** | OFF | Vite already optimizes JS/CSS; rarely worth the build complexity. |
| **Service worker** | OFF | Only enable if you've tested offline behavior. Can cache stale UI in admin. |
| **Image cache max-age** | `31536000` (1 year) | Standard for immutable assets. |
| **Edge caching** | OFF | ON when fronting with a CDN (Cloudflare, Vercel) for the public site. |
| **Edge cache TTL** | `5` min | Long enough to absorb bursts, short enough that publishing feels live. |

---

## 9. Language & text

Two cards. **Languages** first: the site's declared language and any additional ones — the set decides which text layers exist. Then **Visitor text**: the strings *around* your page content (buttons, empty states, search placeholders, form validation) that a page editor cannot reach.

| Control | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Editing** | Which layer you are editing: the base layer (the site's own language) or one `@<locale>` overlay. One layer at a time, because that is how translating happens. |
| **Add a language** | Creates an overlay layer (`en`, `de`, `en-GB`). |
| The key list | Comes from `src/data/ui-text-catalog.json`, generated from the call sites in the code — so keys nobody has translated yet are listed, not hidden. Each field shows the English fallback as its placeholder. |

Anything left blank shows the English written into the product, so a partial translation is safe. Saving merges: other layers and unknown keys are carried through. Block chrome is on the same rail — the form block's *Send message*, *Sending…*, *Thank you!*, *Send another message*, validation messages and *Select…* are `form.*` keys here; the block's own **Button text** and **Success message** still win on a page in the site's language. The full model is in [`architecture/language.md`](../architecture/language.md).

## Where settings live in code

| Concern | File |
|---|---|
| Type definitions + defaults + hooks | `src/hooks/useSiteSettings.tsx` |
| UI panel | `src/pages/admin/SiteSettingsPage.tsx` |
| System AI tab | `src/components/admin/SystemAiSettingsTab.tsx`, resolution in `supabase/functions/_shared/ai-config.ts` |
| Language & text | `src/components/admin/settings/SiteLanguagesSettings.tsx`, `src/components/admin/settings/VisitorTextSettings.tsx`, catalogue `src/data/ui-text-catalog.json` |
| Customer Portal card | `src/components/admin/CustomerPortalCard.tsx` |
| Customer signup edge function | `supabase/functions/customer-signup/index.ts` |
| Storage table | `site_settings` (one row per key, JSONB value) |

Each `useXxxSettings()` hook reads from `site_settings.{key}` with a fallback to the typed default — so the UI always renders even before the row exists. `useUpdateXxxSettings()` upserts the JSON blob.

---

## Best practices summary

1. **Set SEO + AEO before launch.** Both default to safe-but-empty; without them the homepage has no real `<title>` and no LLM discoverability.
2. **Use `Development mode` (SEO tab)** for staging — single switch to block all crawlers.
3. **Keep Customer Portal aligned with active modules.** If you turn off all customer-facing modules (e-commerce, bookings, …), set `Portal enabled = false` to hide `/account`.
4. **Never paste secrets into Custom Scripts.** They are server-rendered into HTML; use `/admin/integrations` for API keys.
5. **Document deviations from defaults.** If your operator changes anything non-obvious here, note it in your runbook — these settings rarely surface in monitoring.
