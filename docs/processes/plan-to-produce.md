# Plan-to-Produce

> From "we need to make more" to finished goods on the shelf: BOM → availability
> check → manufacturing order → work orders → complete → finished-goods stock.
> The making mirror of Order-to-Delivery.

**Problem it solves:** What a product is made of lives in someone's head, nobody knows if components suffice before starting, and finished quantities never match the stock system — this process gives every product a bill of materials, checks component availability before committing, and posts component consumption + finished goods to inventory automatically.

**Maturity level:** L3 — Operational (agent path verified E2E; shop-floor UI is the gap)
**Status:** ✅ PO → goods receipt → MO → confirm → start → complete → finished-goods stock validated live, uncoached, by an external operator (2026-06)

## Modules involved

| Module | Role in the process |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Manufacturing** | BOMs, manufacturing orders, work centers, routing operations, work orders |
| **Products** | The finished good + component catalog (UoM per product) |
| **Inventory** | Component reservation/consumption, finished-goods receipt, valuation layers; inter-warehouse replenishment (`transfer_stock`) + reorder rules (`reorder_rules`) |
| **Purchasing** | Procurement of missing components (`trigger_procurement_for_mo`); reorder review (`list_reorder_candidates`) → MRP draft-MO run (`mrp_reorder_run`, a manufacturing-module skill) |

## Participating modules & skills

| Step | Module | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| Define | manufacturing | `manage_bom` (components + qty per unit), `manage_work_center`, `manage_routing_operation` |
| Plan | manufacturing + purchasing | `mrp_reorder_run`, `trigger_procurement_for_mo` |
| Order | manufacturing | `create_manufacturing_order`, `list_manufacturing_orders`, `check_mo_availability` |
| Execute | manufacturing | `confirm_manufacturing_order` (reserves components) → `generate_mo_work_orders` → `start_manufacturing_order` → `complete_manufacturing_order` (refuses open work orders and short components) — `cancel_manufacturing_order` exits and releases the reservations |
| Stock effects | inventory | availability is read from `stock_quants` less other orders' reservations (the product mirror when no quant exists); completion consumes components FEFO out of WH/MAIN (`mo_consumption` moves priced from the layers) and receives the finished goods into WH/MAIN at material + labor cost (`mo_production` move → valuation layer) |

## Known gaps (parity scorecards)

- ✅ **Shop-floor execution** (2026-08-02) — `progress_work_order` (start/pause/done/cancel) writes `started_at`, `completed_at`, `actual_minutes` and `actual_labor_cost_cents`; the MO card's work-order panel shows actual-vs-planned variance per operation and totals. Still ❌: per-operator work logs and capacity scheduling (`manufacturing#capacity_scheduling`)
- ❌ Backorder/partial MO completion (produce 80 of 100, keep the rest open)
- ✅ **Scrap per operation + quality checks (2026-09-20)** — a routing operation can require a check
  (`requires_inspection`, `inspection_name`); the TABLE refuses to finish a work order until the latest
  check passes (`record_quality_check`, `work_order_inspection_state`). A check is a fact: a new one
  supersedes it, and a failed check on a finished operation reopens it for rework. `record_operation_scrap`
  records what was lost at an operation, capped by the order quantity; `complete_mo` then produces the
  order quantity **minus** the scrap and refuses more. The material and labour already spent stay in the
  cost pool, so the surviving units carry them — the answer says so (`qty_scrapped`,
  `unit_cost_includes_scrap`) instead of hiding a higher unit cost. Still ❌: scrapping COMPONENTS
  (as opposed to units being made) and Odoo's quality-alert workflow.
- ❌ By-products / co-products on the BOM
- ✅ **A machine that is down takes no work (2026-09-20)** — equipment hangs on a work center
  (`equipment.work_center_id`, Odoo's `maintenance.equipment.workcenter_id`). A maintenance request
  says whether it makes the machine unusable (`blocks_equipment`; a critical request does by default,
  as before — but now as a stated fact rather than a side effect of the priority), and the TABLE
  refuses to START a work order at a work center whose equipment is under maintenance or broken.
  `work_center_availability` answers which machine is down and the open request behind it, and
  `maintenance_stats` gives MTBF/MTTR per machine — with no mean until a machine has failed twice.
- ❌ Subcontracted manufacturing
- ⚠️ UoM on BOM lines — components consume in the product's unit; per-line purchase-vs-consume UoM conversion is tracked under products#uom depth

## Best for

Light-assembly SMBs: craft producers, electronics kitting, food/beverage batch makers — anyone whose "manufacturing" is a BOM and a bench, not a factory line.

## Not for

Multi-level MRP with capacity finite-scheduling, subcontracting chains, or process manufacturing with formulas/yields — that is Odoo MRP/PLM territory.
