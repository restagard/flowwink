# Return-to-Refund

> The reverse-logistics mirror of Order-to-Delivery: request → approve → receive →
> inspect → restock → refund.

**Problem it solves:** Returns are handled ad hoc — nobody knows what came back, restocking is guesswork, and refund amounts are worked out on a pocket calculator — this process tracks every RMA from request to refund with the math enforced.

**Maturity level:** L3 — Operational (full RMA lifecycle incl. QC + partial refunds)
**Status:** ✅ Core loop live · F2 depth (reasons/fees/partials) 2026-06-12 · full reverse chain (RTV / pickup / condition-actions) shipped 2026-07-08

## Participating modules & skills

| Step | Module | Skills |
|---|---|---|
| Request | returns | `create_return` (reason_code), `manage_return_item` |
| Approve/receive | returns | `approve_return`, `receive_return` |
| QC | returns + inventory | `inspect_return` (disposition per line → restock into valuation layers, notes, restocking_fee_cents) |
| Refund | returns + invoicing | `refund_return` (partial, Stripe/manual/store_credit) |
| Analyze | returns | `return_reason_report` |

## How it works in practice — the RMA loop

*The adopter lens (see [README](./README.md) § The adopter layer). This is the
canonical home for the RMA state machine — module docs link here and never
restate it.*

### The work story

A customer wants to send something back. Support creates an RMA against the
order with a reason code (defective, wrong item, changed mind, …) — the RMA
number is generated automatically — and adds the lines: which order line,
how many (never more than were sold, across every RMA on the order), the refund
per unit (never more than was paid, and that by default), and whether the item
may go back on the shelf at all. A manager approves. When the parcel arrives,
receiving it only records that the goods are back. QC inspects the goods,
decides per line whether it is restocked or held (refurbish, return to vendor,
scrap), writes notes, and — if the box came back opened — sets a restocking
fee. Then the refund: it can be paid out
in parts (say, the undamaged item now, the rest after a Stripe refund clears),
and the system keeps the running total, shows what remains, and refuses to pay
out more than items-minus-fee. When the total is reached the RMA closes
itself; an operator can also close it early below the total.

### State machine

**`returns.status`** (one RMA per return request; free-text column — the
values below are the ones the shipped transitions write)

| Status | Meaning | Moved forward by | What the transition does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `requested` | Customer asked to return | support / agent (`create_return`) | Creates the RMA (number auto-generated) with a reason code; lines added via `manage_return_item` (qty, `unit_refund_cents`, restock flag) |
| `approved` | Green light to ship it back | admin / agent (`approve_return`) | Only from `requested`; stamps who approved and when, appends notes |
| `received` | Goods are back | admin / agent (`receive_return`) | Only from `approved`; stamps `received_at`. Nothing moves in stock yet |
| *(inspection)* | QC done | admin / agent (`inspect_return`) | **Not a status change** — only valid while `received`; stamps `inspected_at`, notes, sets `restocking_fee_cents` (deducted from the expected refund) and **books the stock movement for every line whose disposition is `restock`** (`chosen_action`, else derived from `condition`; a line with `restock = false` is never restocked) |
| `refunded` | Money returned, RMA closed | admin / agent (`refund_return`) | Allowed from `received` or `approved`. **Each call ADDS `refund_cents` to the running total**; expected total = Σ(line qty × `unit_refund_cents`) − restocking fee, capped by the order total less what the order's other RMAs refunded; over-refund is rejected. Status flips to `refunded` when the total is reached **or** the caller passes `p_final: true` (close below total). Records method (stripe / manual / store_credit) |
| `rejected` / `cancelled` | — | ⚠️ recognized by the admin UI, but **no transition writes them yet** | — |

### Who does what

See the Agent coverage table below — the full loop (create → approve →
receive → inspect → refund) runs manually in ReturnsPage and end-to-end over
MCP; inspection and refunds require admin trust.

### Coming from spreadsheets

- The "returer"-flik with free-text reasons → reason codes that `return_reason_report` can actually aggregate
- The warehouse post-it "kan säljas igen?" → the restock flag per line; receiving posts the stock movement for you
- The calculator session "hur mycket ska tillbaka?" → the system computes items − restocking fee and blocks over-refunds
- The "har vi betalat tillbaka?" column → running refunded/remaining on the RMA; it closes itself at the total

## Shipped (2026-07-08) — RMA now covers the full reverse chain

- ✅ **Return-to-vendor (RTV)** — `return_to_vendor` links a customer RMA to a supplier
  return + expected vendor credit (ties into `vendor_credit_memos` from purchasing) when
  goods are the supplier's fault.
- ✅ **Automated return email + label** — on RMA approval the customer gets a return
  confirmation (via `email-send`) with instructions + a return shipping label reference
  (`create_return_label`).
- ✅ **Reverse-logistics pickup** — `return_pickups` schedules a carrier pickup
  (date/address/carrier/status) via `manage_carrier_pickup`.
- ✅ **Condition-based actions** — the `inspect_return` QC step drives the next action from
  the graded condition (new→restock, damaged→scrap/RTV, used→refurbish).
