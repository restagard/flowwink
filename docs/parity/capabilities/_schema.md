# Capability File Schema

Each module that we track for Odoo parity has **one** file here:
`docs/parity/capabilities/<module>.json`.

These files are the **single source of truth** for the parity score. The
human-readable matrix (`docs/parity/parity-matrix.md`) is *generated* from them by
`scripts/parity-report.ts` — never edit the matrix by hand.

A capability is a single, verifiable unit of functionality. When a dev agent
ships a capability, the **only** parity bookkeeping required is to flip that
capability's `status` in this file. CI recomputes the score from the diff.

## Format

```jsonc
{
  "module": "products",                       // matches src/lib/modules/<module>-module.ts
  "odoo_app": "Sales / Inventory",            // the Odoo app(s) we benchmark against
  "current_maturity": "L3",                   // mirrors the L1–L5 in the module manifest
  "target_maturity": "L4",
  "capabilities": [
    {
      "id": "variants",                       // stable slug, never reused
      "name": "Product variants (attributes → SKUs)",
      "odoo": true,                           // does Odoo's app have this? Only odoo:true counts toward parity %
      "status": "missing",                    // done | partial | missing
      "weight": 3,                            // 1 = normal · 2 = important · 3 = foundational/critical
      "epic": "EPIC-01",                      // optional: the epic that delivers it
      "verify": "src/lib/modules/products-module.ts exposes manage_variant; product_variants table exists",
      "notes": "Blocks e-commerce, POS and inventory simultaneously."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Scoring

For one module, over capabilities where `odoo == true`:

```
score_weight  = done → 1.0 · partial → 0.5 · missing → 0.0
parity_pct    = Σ(weight × score_weight) / Σ(weight) × 100
```

Capabilities with `odoo: false` are FlowWink differentiators (e.g. AI enrichment).
They are listed for completeness and shown in the matrix, but **excluded** from the
parity denominator — we do not penalise ourselves for features Odoo lacks.

## Rules for dev agents

1. **Never delete a capability id.** Mark it `done`; history stays auditable.
2. **`status: partial`** requires a one-line `notes` saying what is still missing.
3. **`status: done`** requires the `verify` field to be true *right now* — a reviewer
   (human or agent) must be able to confirm it from the code, not from intent.
   Per the **dual-surface law**, `done` also means the capability exists as **both**
   an MCP skill (in `skillSeeds`, `mcp_exposed=true`) **and** a human admin UI.
   Ship only one surface → cap at `partial`.
4. Adding a brand-new gap you discovered? Append a capability with `status: missing`.
   Breadth grows by never leaving a known gap unrecorded.
5. **`done` is reserved for Stage 3 of the pipeline** ([`../pipeline.md`](../pipeline.md)):
   only an agent that ran the capability through the real runtime (per
   [`../verification-loop.md`](../verification-loop.md)) may set `done`. Agents
   without runtime access (cloud/CI) may flip `missing` → `partial` at most.
6. **`done` must survive the process battery.** A capability that a process doc
   ([`../../processes/`](../../processes/)) exercises is `done` only while its
   checks in `scripts/process-battery/` are green. A check listed in
   `known-red.json` caps the capability at `partial`, with a dated `notes` line
   naming what the battery showed — and the fix PR that turns the check green is
   the one that flips it back. "The skill exists and answers success" is what the
   scorecard measured the week returns scored 100 % and refunded more than the
   order total (2026-09-17); the end state in the database is the evidence.
