Key rules:
- Follow `ModuleDefinition<I, O>` contract pattern
- All schema changes require idempotent migrations
- Skills must be self-describing ([Law 2](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- Blocks are interfaces, not pipelines ([Law 3](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- New skills must pass the [Agent Contract Integrity](../../mem/architecture/agent-contract-integrity.md) checklist (`bun run lint:skills`)
