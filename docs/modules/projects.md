## Skills

These skills are seeded into `agent_skills` when the module is enabled and exposed via MCP.
External operators (FlowPilot, OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, custom MCP clients) can call them directly.

| Skill | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `manage_project` | internal | Create, update, search, and close projects. Use when: starting new client work, updating project status, reviewing active projects. NOT for: individual tasks (use manage_project_task), timesheets (… |
| `manage_project_task` | internal | Create, update, move, and list tasks within a project. Use when: adding work items, moving tasks on the kanban board, checking task status. NOT for: CRM tasks (use manage_crm_tasks), project-level … |
| `manage_project_milestone` | internal | Manage project milestones (named delivery gates with a due date and task-completion progress). Use when: planning project phases, marking a milestone reached, tracking gate progress. NOT for: indiv… |
| `manage_project_template` | internal | Reusable project templates: snapshot an existing project (tasks + milestones with day offsets) or author a spec, then instantiate new projects from it. Use when: the same project structure repeats … |
| `manage_project_member` | internal | Team and stakeholder roles on a project: add/update/remove members with a role, rate override and time-tracking flag. Use when: staffing a project, setting a member\ |
| `project_cost_forecast` | internal | Cost forecasting and burn rate for a project: hours logged, cost (member rate overrides honored), 4-week burn rate, weeks until budget exhaustion, over-budget risk from open task estimates. Use whe… |
| `manage_task_workflow` | internal | Stage-workflow gating per project: restrict which task status transitions are allowed, require sub-tasks done before a parent closes, and block starting tasks with unfinished dependencies. Use when… |
| `manage_task_dependency` | internal | Task dependencies (finish-to-start edges) within a project, with cycle detection. Use when: task B cannot start before task A is done; building a Gantt/dependency plan. NOT for: sub-task hierarchy … |
| `project_portfolio_brief` | internal | The portfolio at a glance for an agent that watches projects: blocked tasks and what they wait on, hub blockers, external waits, stalled work, undated tasks, what is ready. Counts only — needs no dates, hours or rates. |
| `get_project_schedule` | internal | Gantt-ready schedule for a project: every task with start/due dates, estimated hours, dependency edges and topological depth, plus milestones. Use when: rendering a timeline/Gantt, planning order o… |
| `resource_capacity_report` | internal | Resource/capacity planning: per person — open tasks, estimated hours of backlog, hours logged, utilization % against weekly capacity, overload flag. Use when: "who has room for this?", spotting ove… |

- [quote-to-cash](../processes/quote-to-cash.md)

## File Map

| Purpose | Path |
|---------|------|
| Module definition | `src/lib/modules/projects-module.ts` |
| Hook | `src/hooks/useProjects.ts` |
| Admin page | `src/pages/admin/ProjectsPage.tsx` |

## Contributing

To enhance this module, see [Contributing Guide](../contributing/contributing.md).

Key rules:
- Follow `ModuleDefinition<I, O>` contract pattern
- All schema changes require idempotent migrations
- Skills must be self-describing ([Law 2](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- Blocks are interfaces, not pipelines ([Law 3](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- New skills must pass the [Agent Contract Integrity](../../mem/architecture/agent-contract-integrity.md) checklist (`bun run lint:skills`)
