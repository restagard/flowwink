## Skills

These skills are seeded into `agent_skills` when the module is enabled and exposed via MCP.
External operators (FlowPilot, OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, custom MCP clients) can call them directly.

| Skill | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `manage_bom` | internal | Create a new Bill of Materials (BOM) version for a product. Use when: defining what components make up a finished good, or adding a new versioned recipe. NOT for: planning a production run (use cre… |
| `create_manufacturing_order` | internal | Plan a production run for a finished good. Creates a draft Manufacturing Order (MO). Use when: stock of a manufacturable product is low, a sales order needs to be built, or admin requests a build. … |
| `confirm_manufacturing_order` | internal | Snapshot the active BOM into a draft MO and compute component availability. Use when: an MO has been created and is ready to be reserved. NOT for: starting work on the floor (use start_manufacturin… |
| `check_mo_availability` | internal | Re-compute component availability for a confirmed MO and return any shortages. Read-only against state but updates the per-component cache. Use when: re-checking after a goods receipt, or before de… |
| `trigger_procurement_for_mo` | internal | For each component short on stock, mark as awaiting_po and return a list of procurement requests. Idempotent — skips components that already have an open PO referencing this MO. Use when: check_mo_… |
| `start_manufacturing_order` | internal | Transition a confirmed MO to in_progress and stamp started_at. Use when: floor operator (or agent with auto trust) confirms work has begun. NOT for: completing the MO (use complete_manufacturing_or… |
| `complete_manufacturing_order` | internal | Finish an in-progress MO: refuses while work orders are open or components are short; consumes components FEFO out of the warehouse (mo_consumption moves, priced from the valuation layers), puts th… |
| `cancel_manufacturing_order` | internal | Cancel a draft, confirmed, or in-progress MO with a reason: releases the component reservations confirm took and cancels open work orders. Idempotent — safe to call on already-cancelled or done MOs… |
| `list_manufacturing_orders` | internal | List Manufacturing Orders, optionally filtered by status. Read-only. Use when: building a dashboard, triaging the queue, or summarizing factory load. NOT for: detailed component view (read mo_compo… |
| `manage_work_center` | internal | Manage work centers (production resources with an hourly cost + capacity). Use when: defining the shop floor (cutting, assembly, packing), setting labor rates. NOT for: routing steps (manage_routin… |
| `manage_routing_operation` | internal | Manage the ordered routing operations of a BOM (which work center, how many minutes per unit). Use when: defining how a product is made step by step. NOT for: work centers (manage_work_center) or g… |
| `generate_mo_work_orders` | internal | Materialise a manufacturing order\ |
| `progress_work_order` | internal | Run a manufacturing work order on the shop floor: start, pause, finish or cancel it, recording actual minutes and actual labor cost. Use when: reporting shop-floor progress or time spent on an oper… |
| `record_quality_check` | internal | Record the result of a quality inspection on a work order (pass or fail), with the measured value. Use when: an operation that requires inspection has been checked, or a later check supersedes an e… |
| `work_order_inspection_state` | internal | Read whether a work order needs a quality check, what the latest result was, and the whole check history. Use when: deciding whether an operation can be finished, or reporting why it cannot. NOT fo… |
| `record_operation_scrap` | internal | Record units scrapped at one operation of a manufacturing order — what was started but will never be finished. Use when: parts crack, a batch fails, units are lost at a station. NOT for: a failed q… |
| `mrp_reorder_run` | internal | Scan manufactured products (those with an active BOM) below their reordering rule and create draft manufacturing orders to replenish. The threshold is reorder_rules.min_qty with procurement_method=… |

## Contributing

To enhance this module, see [Contributing Guide](../contributing/contributing.md).

Key rules:
- Follow `ModuleDefinition<I, O>` contract pattern
- All schema changes require idempotent migrations
- Skills must be self-describing ([Law 2](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- Blocks are interfaces, not pipelines ([Law 3](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- New skills must pass the [Agent Contract Integrity](../../mem/architecture/agent-contract-integrity.md) checklist (`bun run lint:skills`)
