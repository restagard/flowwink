## Skills

These skills are seeded into `agent_skills` when the module is enabled and exposed via MCP.
External operators (FlowPilot, OpenClaw, Claude Desktop, custom MCP clients) can call them directly.

| Skill | Scope | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| `transfer_stock` | internal | Move stock between two locations (e.g. WH/MAIN → WH/PRODUCTION). Use when: relocating goods, fulfilling internal pick lists, or moving items to scrap. NOT for: receiving from vendor (use receive_pu… |
| `reserve_stock` | internal | Soft-reserve quantity at a location for an MO or sales order. Decrements available stock without moving it. Use when: confirming an MO, allocating stock to a sales order. NOT for: physically moving… |
| `cancel_reservation` | internal | Release a previously reserved quantity back to available stock. Use when: an MO or SO is cancelled. Idempotent on already-cancelled reservations. |
| `consume_reservation` | internal | Convert a reservation into an actual stock-out: moves the reserved qty out of the source location to a destination (default WH/CUSTOMERS). Use when: shipping the SO or finishing the MO consumption.… |
| `adjust_quant` | internal | Manual stock adjustment at a specific location (positive or negative delta). Use when: stocktake correction, breakage, or initial seed. NOT for: vendor receipts (use receive_purchase_order). |
| `manage_reorder_rule` | both | Read and write the reordering (min/max) rules that drive every replenishment engine — the first step of procure-to-pay. Actions: list, get, set, deactivate, delete. A rule says "when virtual stock … |
| `procurement_run` | internal | Run the MRP scheduler: scans all active reorder rules, computes virtual stock (on_hand − reserved + incoming PO), and creates pending procurement_suggestions for products below min_qty. Skips produ… |
| `approve_procurement_suggestion` | internal | Materialize a pending procurement suggestion into a real Purchase Order (buy) or Manufacturing Order (manufacture). Use when: admin/agent has reviewed a suggestion and wants to act on it. Admin-only. |
| `reject_procurement_suggestion` | internal | Reject a pending procurement suggestion with an optional reason. Admin-only. Use when: buyer declines an auto-generated reorder suggestion / "reject procurement" / "avvisa förslag". NOT for: approv… |
| `allocate_picking` | both | Create a pick-list for a paid order: generates a picking_order, reserves stock per order line, and flags stockouts. Idempotent — reuses existing open picking_order for the same order. Use when: an … |
| `confirm_pick` | both | Operator confirms a single pick line: records picked quantity and optional lot/serial. Auto-advances the picking_order status when all lines are picked or short. Use when: warehouse operator scans/… |
| `ship_picking` | both | Ship a fully-picked picking_order: consumes reservations into real outbound stock_moves, sets order.status=shipped, emits picking.shipped event with tracking info. Use when: package leaves the ware… |
| `cancel_picking` | both | Cancel an open picking_order and release all its reservations. Use when: order is cancelled or stock is unavailable. Idempotent. |
| `inventory_valuation_report` | internal | Stock valuation report: on-hand quantity, average unit cost and total value per product from the valuation layers (FIFO/average costing). Use when: reviewing inventory value for the balance sheet, … |
| `allocate_landed_cost` | internal | Allocate freight/duty/customs onto a receipt: distributes the amount across the valuation layers of a purchase receipt (by value or quantity), raising unit costs, and posts Dt 1460 / Cr 5710. Use w… |
| `inventory_gl_reconciliation` | internal | Reconciliation check: does GL account 1460 tie out to the inventory valuation layers? Returns both balances, the difference, and how much is explained by non-purchase receipts. Use when: month-end … |
| `manage_inventory_count` | internal | Run a physical cycle count: open a count for a location, snapshot system quantities, record counted quantities, and post variances to stock. Use when: stocktake, periodic cycle count, reconciling o… |
| `manage_inventory_receipt` | internal | Receive goods in steps: create a receipt with lines, record quality control per line, then advance it received → quality_check → putaway → done. Putaway posts the stock moves to each line\ |

## Contributing

To enhance this module, see [Contributing Guide](../contributing/contributing.md).

Key rules:
- Follow `ModuleDefinition<I, O>` contract pattern
- All schema changes require idempotent migrations
- Skills must be self-describing ([Law 2](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- Blocks are interfaces, not pipelines ([Law 3](../concepts/openclaw-law.md))
- New skills must pass the [Agent Contract Integrity](../../mem/architecture/agent-contract-integrity.md) checklist (`bun run lint:skills`)
