FlowWink exposes ~600+ MCP skills. A focused **department claw** picks up
one composite group and runs that department end-to-end — without FlowPilot.

| Department | Playbook | Composite group | Brief |
|------------|----------|-----------------|-------|
| 📣 Marketing | [marketing-claw-playbook.md](./marketing-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=marketing` | Paid ads, content, research, analytics |
| 💼 Sales | [sales-claw-playbook.md](./sales-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=sales` | Prospecting, deals, quotes, contracts |
| 🛟 Support | [support-claw-playbook.md](./support-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=support` | Ticket triage, KB answers, SLA |
| 💚 Customer Success | [success-claw-playbook.md](./success-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=success` | Retention, NPS, expansion, churn save |
| 💰 Finance | [finance-claw-playbook.md](./finance-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=finance` | Invoicing, expenses, reconciliation, close |
| 📦 Operations | [operations-claw-playbook.md](./operations-claw-playbook.md) | `?groups=operations` | Orders, stock, purchasing, manufacturing |

## How a claw connects

```http
POST https://<your-flowwink>.lovable.app/functions/v1/mcp-server
Authorization: Bearer <MCP_API_KEY>
```

Get a key from `/admin/developer → MCP Keys`. Discover live state with
`GET /rest/groups`.

## Why composite groups

Each group expands to multiple internal skill categories. The claw doesn't
need to know FlowWink's internal taxonomy — it just asks for `marketing` and
gets the full toolkit. See `mem://architecture/mcp-toolset-groups-and-tool-bloat-strategy`.

## What every department playbook covers

1. **Connect** — MCP endpoint and auth
2. **Pull the toolkit** — `?groups=<name>` and what it expands to
3. **End-to-end loop** — concrete JSON-RPC calls for a full workflow
4. **Approval gating** — which skills are `notify` (instant) vs `approve` (HIL)
5. **What's NOT exposed** — and why
6. **Audit & limits** — rate limits, audit trail, multi-tenancy notes
7. **Related** — memory and module references

## One claw per department

Recommended pattern: one external claw owns one department per FlowWink site.
FlowPilot remains the generalist; department claws are the specialists.
