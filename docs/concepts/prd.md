## 1. Vision & Positioning

FlowWink is a **Business Operating System (BOS)** — a self-hosted platform where an autonomous AI agent (FlowPilot) operates your entire business. Built for era three of business software:

1. **Tools era** (1990s–2010s) — Separate apps. You operate each one manually.
2. **SaaS era** (2010s–2020s) — Cloud platforms. Easier to use, still human-driven.
3. **Agent era** (2025–) — AI operators. You set direction, the agent runs the business.

### The Core Insight

Every business has **directional work** (strategy, decisions — requires humans) and **operational work** (executing, iterating, following up — increasingly automatable). FlowWink takes all operational work off your plate. You set objectives. FlowPilot executes.

### Odoo-Inspired ERP for SMBs

FlowWink is an Odoo-inspired BOS where FlowPilot functions as the primary autonomous operator for the full **Quote-to-Cash** lifecycle. The UI is a cockpit for exception handling, not a traditional form-based admin.

### Module Ecosystem (Odoo Model)

FlowWink follows Odoo's module ecosystem model with three tiers:

| Tier | Name | Origin | Trust | Status |
|------|------|--------|-------|--------|
| **1** | **Core Modules** | Bundled in repo | `bundled` / full trust | ✅ Active (68 modules) |
| **2** | **Community-Submitted** | PR → FlowWink review → merge | `bundled` after review | 🔜 Next |
| **3** | **External/Marketplace** | Loaded at runtime from external source | `community` + admin install | 🔮 Future |

**How it works:**

- **Tier 1**: All current modules (Blog, CRM, Ecommerce, Accounting, etc.). Skills declared in `skill-map.ts`, lifecycle managed via `registerBootstrap()`.
- **Tier 2**: Developers submit modules following the `new-module.md` workflow. After FlowWink team review and merge, the module ships as bundled with full trust. Modules can declare **skills + automations + seedData** — same power as core modules (e.g., Accounting pilot with BAS 2024 chart of accounts, templates, and scheduled automations).
- **Tier 3**: Future plugin-loader pattern. DB support exists (`agent_skill_packs` table, `origin='community'`, `trust_level` field) but runtime loading is not yet implemented.

**Bootstrap Contract** (applies to Tier 1 + 2):

```typescript
registerBootstrap('myModule', {
  seedData: async () => { /* seed reference data */ },
  skills: [{ name, description, category, handler, scope, tool_definition }],
  automations: [{ name, trigger_type, trigger_config, skill_name, skill_arguments }],
});
```

When enabled: seeds data → enables skills → registers automations.  
When disabled: sets `enabled=false` on skills/automations. Data preserved.  
FlowPilot off: skills/automations skipped entirely (shell mode).  
FlowPilot enabled later: retroactive scan bootstraps all active modules.

### Design Principles

1. **Agents, not automation** — FlowPilot reasons about context and adapts, not follows scripts.
2. **Self-evolution over configuration** — The agent creates skills, learns templates, enriches memory.
3. **Privacy by architecture** — Your agent, your data, your AI. Self-hosted with private LLM support.
4. **OpenClaw compliance** — 10 mandatory laws for agent architecture. See [OPENCLAW-LAW.md](./openclaw-law.md).
5. **The 80/20 rule, enforced** — Build core deeply. For the rest, integrate via webhooks and Workflow DAGs.

### Three-Channel Architecture

FlowWink exposes its capabilities through three complementary channels:

| Channel | Purpose | Auth | Transport |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| **Skills** (internal) | FlowPilot autonomy — agent reasons and executes | Service role JWT | Edge Function (`agent-execute`) |
| **A2A** (federation) | Peer-to-peer agent collaboration (e.g. OpenClaw) | Bearer token (hashed) | JSON-RPC via `a2a/ingest` |
| **MCP** (universal) | External AI clients (Cursor, Claude Desktop) | API Key (SHA-256 hashed) | Streamable HTTP via `mcp-server` |

The MCP server dynamically exposes skills where `mcp_exposed = true` in the `agent_skills` table. Admin controls which skills are public via the Engine Room UI (shield toggle). API keys are managed under **Developer → MCP Keys**.

#### Universal CRUD via MCP

Every module that registers `db:*` skills (e.g. `db:employees`, `db:projects`, `db:leads`) automatically gets full CRUD through MCP — no per-module code required. The `agent-execute` edge function contains a **generic CRUD engine** that:

1. Validates the table against a security whitelist (`GENERIC_CRUD_TABLES`)
2. Maps the `action` parameter (`list`, `get`, `create`, `update`, `delete`) to SQL
3. Auto-applies filters, pagination, and `updated_at` timestamps
4. Returns structured JSON results

This means any new module that registers a `db:tablename` skill with a standard `action` enum is **instantly operable** via MCP, FlowPilot chat, and automations — zero additional backend code.

#### MCP Resources

The server exposes inspection resources for agent discovery:

| Resource URI | Description |
|---|---|
| `flowwink://health` | Site statistics, active objectives |
| `flowwink://skills` | Full skill registry with metadata |
| `flowwink://activity` | Recent FlowPilot actions |
| `flowwink://modules` | Module configuration and status |
| `flowwink://peers` | Federation peer status |
| `flowwink://identity` | FlowPilot's soul and configuration |
| `flowwink://templates/{id}` | Template structure for auditing |

#### MCP Client Configuration (Cursor / Claude Desktop)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flowwink": {
      "transport": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://<project-ref>.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-server",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer fwk_<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Security Model

- API keys are SHA-256 hashed — raw key shown only at creation (`fwk_` prefix)
- Keys have optional scopes limiting to specific skill categories
- Keys have optional expiry dates
- `mcp_exposed` acts as a second gate — even with a valid key, only explicitly exposed skills are callable
- Module-level gating: disabled modules hide their skills from MCP
- Generic CRUD whitelist prevents access to tables not explicitly registered

### Request Flow

```
Visitor → PublicPage.tsx → get-page edge function → page.content_json
                         → BlockRenderer.tsx → [Name]Block.tsx

Admin   → PageEditorPage.tsx → BlockEditor.tsx → [Name]BlockEditor.tsx
```

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + Vite 5 + Tailwind CSS v3 + TypeScript 5
- **Backend**: Supabase (Postgres + Edge Functions + Auth + Storage)
- **AI**: OpenAI, Google Gemini, Private LLM (OpenAI-compatible)
- **Agent**: OpenClaw-compliant autonomous engine

## 12. Module Bootstrap Architecture

When a module is enabled, it can optionally run a **bootstrap** that seeds everything it needs:

```
Module.enable("accounting")
  → Always: Seed reference data (chart of accounts, templates)
  → Always: Run migrations if tables missing
  → If FlowPilot.enabled: Register skills + automations in agent registry
  → If !FlowPilot.enabled: Skip skills (pure UI module)

Module.disable("accounting")
  → Deactivate skills (enabled=false, data preserved)
  → Deactivate automations
  → Reference data untouched

FlowPilot.enable()
  → Scan all enabled modules → seed their skills

FlowPilot.disable()
  → Skills become irrelevant (no agent runs them)
  → Modules continue working as traditional UI
```

### Implementation

- **Registry**: `src/lib/module-bootstrap.ts` — core bootstrap/teardown engine
- **Bootstraps**: `src/lib/module-bootstraps/*.ts` — per-module seed configs
- **Hook point**: `ModulesPage.tsx` `handleToggle` calls `bootstrapModule()` / `teardownModule()`
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times (check-then-insert pattern)

### Pilot: Accounting Module

The accounting module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/accounting.ts`) seeds:
- **43 BAS 2024 accounts** (chart of accounts)
- **7 transaction templates** (invoice, payment, payroll, rent, etc.)
- **6 skills** (`manage_journal_entry`, `accounting_reports`, `manage_accounting_template`, `manage_opening_balances`, `manage_chart_of_accounts`, `suggest_accounting_template`)
- **1 automation** (`Invoice Reconciliation` — daily cron checking for unbooked invoices)

### Expense Reporting Module

The expenses module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/expenses.ts`) is a standalone module with a dependency on Accounting for journal entry booking:

- **Tables**: `expenses`, `expense_reports`, `expense_attachments`
- **2 skills**: `manage_expenses` (full CRUD + approval workflow), `analyze_receipt` (AI vision extraction)
- **1 automation**: `Monthly Expense Processing` (1st of each month — collects drafts, submits reports, prompts admin)
- **Representation rule**: Expenses categorized as `representation` require an `attendees` list (name + company) — Swedish tax compliance
- **Autonomous workflow**: Draft → Submit → Approve → Book (FlowPilot generates journal entries: net cost to expense account, VAT to 2640, liability to 2820)
- **Receipt scanning**: Uses multimodal AI vision (Gemini/OpenAI) via the `analyze-receipt` edge function to extract vendor, date, amount, VAT, and suggest account codes

### Timesheets & Project Management Module

The timesheets module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/timesheets.ts`) provides full project management with task tracking, time logging, and budget monitoring:

- **Tables**: `projects` (name, client, color, hourly_rate, billable, budget_hours, deadline), `project_tasks` (title, description, status, priority, assigned_to, due_date, estimated_hours, completed_at), `project_members` (user, role, hourly_rate_override, tracks_time), `time_entries` (user, project, task_id, date, hours, description, billable, invoiced)
- **4 skills**: `log_time` (create/list/delete time entries), `manage_projects` (CRUD for projects), `manage_tasks` (create/update/list/delete project tasks with kanban status), `timesheet_summary` (period summaries with revenue calculation)
- **2 automations**: `Weekly Timesheet Reminder` (Fridays 15:00 — checks if employees have logged ≥35h), `Project Budget Alert` (Mondays 09:00 — checks projects exceeding 90% budget)
- **Task kanban**: Four-column board (To Do → In Progress → Review → Done) with priority badges, due dates, assigned members, and estimated hours
- **Budget tracking**: Per-project progress bars showing logged vs budgeted hours, revenue calculation for billable projects, over-budget alerts
- **Weekly timesheet**: Grid layout with projects as rows, weekdays as columns, quick-add for inline hour logging
- **Billable tracking**: Projects have hourly rates; `timesheet_summary` calculates revenue from billable hours
- **Task-level time logging**: Time entries can optionally reference a specific task via `task_id`
- **Auto-completion**: Database trigger automatically sets `completed_at` when task status changes to "done"
- **Invoice integration**: "From Timesheets" dialog generates invoice drafts from billable hours — aggregates time entries by project and period
- **FlowPilot chat**: Natural language — "create a task to design the landing page" triggers `manage_tasks`, "I worked 4 hours on X" triggers `log_time`
- **RLS**: Authenticated users can CRUD tasks and time entries; invoiced entries cannot be deleted

### Invoicing Module (Quote-to-Cash)

The invoicing module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/invoicing.ts`) closes the Quote-to-Cash loop by connecting deals, timesheets, and accounting:

- **Tables**: `invoices` (invoice_number, status enum [draft/sent/paid/overdue/cancelled], customer info, line_items JSONB, totals, tax_rate, due_date, issue_date, payment_terms, project_id, deal_id, lead_id), `quotes` (quote_number, valid_until, accept→invoice conversion)
- **3 skills**: `manage_invoice` (full CRUD + status lifecycle), `invoice_from_timesheets` (aggregate billable hours → invoice draft), `invoice_overdue_check` (find/flag overdue invoices)
- **1 automation**: `Invoice Overdue Check` (daily 08:00 — flags sent invoices past due_date as overdue)
- **Timesheet billing**: "From Timesheets" dialog lets admin select billable project + period, previews hours and total, generates invoice draft with time entries as line items
- **Quote→Invoice**: Accepted quotes auto-convert to invoice drafts with line items and customer data preserved
- **PDF generation**: `generate-invoice-pdf` edge function renders invoice as downloadable PDF
- **Status lifecycle**: draft → sent (sets sent_at) → paid (sets paid_at) | overdue (auto-flagged) | cancelled
- **Accounting bridge**: When invoice is marked paid, FlowPilot can trigger `manage_journal_entry` to book revenue (via accounting reconciliation automation)
- **FlowPilot chat**: "create invoice for project X" triggers `manage_invoice`, "invoice the hours from last month" triggers `invoice_from_timesheets`

### Inventory Module

The inventory module tracks stock levels across all e-commerce products with automatic order integration:

- **Tables**: `product_stock` (product_id, quantity_on_hand, quantity_reserved, reorder_point), `stock_moves` (product_id, quantity, move_type, reference_type, reference_id, notes)
- **3 skills**: `check_stock` (query stock levels), `adjust_stock` (manual in/out/adjustment), `low_stock_report` (products below reorder point)
- **Auto-decrement**: Database trigger on `orders` table automatically creates stock moves and decrements `quantity_on_hand` when orders are placed
- **Admin UI**: Three-tab layout — Stock Levels (with inline reorder point editing), Movements log, and Untracked products (enable tracking per product)
- **KPI cards**: Tracked products, stock value, low stock count, out of stock count
- **E-commerce integration**: Leverages existing `back_in_stock_requests` table for notifications
- **RLS**: Authenticated users can view; writers/admins can modify stock and create moves

### Purchasing Module (Procure-to-Pay)

The purchasing module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/purchasing.ts`) automates the full Procure-to-Pay lifecycle:

- **Tables**: `vendors` (name, email, phone, payment_terms, currency, is_active), `vendor_products` (vendor_id, product_id, vendor_sku, lead_time_days, unit_price_cents, is_preferred), `purchase_orders` (vendor, status, PO number, order_date, expected_delivery, totals), `purchase_order_lines` (product, description, quantity, unit_price, tax_rate, received_quantity), `goods_receipts` (PO reference, receipt_date, received_by, notes)
- **5 skills**: `manage_vendor` (CRUD for suppliers), `create_purchase_order` (draft POs with line items), `send_purchase_order` (transition draft → sent), `receive_goods` (record goods receipt + update inventory), `purchase_reorder_check` (analyze stock levels → suggest POs)
- **1 automation**: `Auto Reorder Check` (daily 07:00 — checks products below reorder threshold, creates draft POs grouped by vendor)
- **Auto-stock update**: Goods receipt automatically creates `stock_moves` and updates `product_stock.quantity_on_hand`
- **PO numbering**: Database trigger auto-generates sequential PO numbers (PO-00001, PO-00002…)
- **Status flow**: Draft → Sent → Partially Received → Received → Cancelled
- **Vendor products**: Track lead times, preferred vendors, and vendor-specific pricing per product
- **FlowPilot autonomy**: Heartbeat detects low stock → suggests POs → admin approves → PO sent → goods arrive → inventory updated
- **Swedish defaults**: 25% tax rate, SEK currency

---

### Order Fulfillment Flow

The fulfillment flow extends the Orders module with warehouse-style tracking from payment to delivery:

- **Columns on `orders`**: `fulfillment_status` (unfulfilled → picked → packed → shipped → delivered), `picked_at`, `packed_at`, `shipped_at`, `delivered_at`, `tracking_number`, `tracking_url`, `fulfillment_notes`
- **Auto-timestamping**: Database trigger automatically fills in earlier timestamps when status advances (e.g. marking as "shipped" auto-sets picked_at and packed_at if not already set)
- **Order status sync**: Advancing to "shipped" sets order status to `shipped`; "delivered" sets it to `completed`
- **Admin UI**: Visual stepper showing fulfillment progress with timestamps, tracking info display, and one-click advancement buttons per stage
- **SLA-ready**: Timestamps enable SLA Monitor to track `fulfillment_time` policies (e.g. "orders must ship within 4 hours of payment")

### SLA Monitor Module

The SLA Monitor (`src/pages/admin/SlaMonitorPage.tsx`) enables policy-based service level tracking with autonomous violation detection:

- **Tables**: `sla_policies` (entity_type, metric, target_minutes, severity, enabled), `sla_violations` (policy_id, entity_type, entity_id, severity, actual_minutes, target_minutes, resolved_at)
- **1 skill**: `sla_check` (evaluate all active SLA policies, detect violations, auto-resolve when entities are handled)
- **Backing RPC**: `run_sla_sweep` (SQL function, invoked by the `sla_check` skill) — iterates over active policies, queries entity tables for breaches, upserts violations, and auto-resolves previously violated entities that are now handled
- **Supported entity types**: `ticket`, `order`, `lead`, `booking`
- **Supported metrics**: `first_response_time`, `resolution_time`, `fulfillment_time`, `follow_up_time`
- **Severity levels**: `warning` (approaching SLA), `breach` (exceeded SLA), `critical` (2x exceeded)
- **Admin UI**: Policy management (create/toggle/delete) + violations dashboard with severity badges and resolution status
- **Autonomy**: FlowPilot runs `sla_check` during heartbeat to proactively detect and escalate SLA breaches. Fully `agent-capable` — no admin intervention needed after initial policy setup

### Contracts Module

The contracts module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/contracts.ts`) manages the full contract lifecycle:

- **Tables**: `contracts` (title, contract_type, status, counterparty_name/email, start/end_date, renewal_type, renewal_notice_days, value_cents, currency, file_url, notes, signed_at, terminated_at), `contract_documents` (contract_id, file_name, file_url, file_type, version, uploaded_by)
- **Status flow**: `draft` → `pending_signature` → `active` → `expired` / `terminated`
- **Contract types**: service, nda, employment, lease, other
- **Renewal tracking**: `none`, `auto`, `manual` with configurable notice period in days
- **UI** (`ContractsPage.tsx`): Filterable list by status, expiration alerts for contracts ending within 30 days, create/edit dialog with all fields
- **FlowPilot skills**: `manage_contract` (CRUD + search), `contract_renewal_check` (finds expiring contracts grouped by urgency)
- **Automation**: Daily renewal alert (weekdays 08:00) — FlowPilot checks for contracts expiring within 30 days
- **Future**: Document versioning upload via `contract_documents` table, digital signature integration

### HR & Employees Module

The HR module (`src/lib/module-bootstraps/hr.ts`) manages the employee lifecycle:

- **Tables**: `employees` (name, email, phone, title, department, employment_type, start_date, end_date, status, avatar_url, emergency_contact, notes), `leave_requests` (employee_id, leave_type, start/end_date, days, status, reason, reviewed_by/at), `onboarding_checklists` (employee_id, title, items JSON, completed_at), `employee_documents` (employee_id, file_name, file_url, file_type, category)
- **Employee status flow**: `active` → `on_leave` → `active`, or `active` → `terminated`
- **Leave types**: vacation, sick, parental, other
- **Leave status flow**: `pending` → `approved` / `rejected` / `cancelled`
- **Document categories**: contract, id, certificate, other
- **UI** (`HRPage.tsx`): KPI cards (active, on leave, pending requests), tabbed view with employee directory + leave management, inline approve/reject
- **FlowPilot skills**: `manage_employee` (CRUD + search), `manage_leave` (create/approve/reject/list), `onboarding_checklist` (create/update/status)
- **Automation**: Daily leave review reminder (weekdays 09:00) — FlowPilot lists pending requests for admin
- **Navigation**: Operations → HR & Employees
- **Future**: Employee self-service portal, document upload, calendar integration, absence analytics

## Roadmap — Architecture Evolution

### Phase 1: Lazy-load heavy modules (Short-term)
Use dynamic `import()` for modules with large bootstrap data (accounting BAS charts, templates, site-migration). Keeps static registry metadata but defers heavy logic until the module is actually activated. Reduces initial bundle size without architectural changes.

### Phase 2: Manifest / Implementation split (Medium-term)
Separate each module into two layers:
- **Manifest** (static) — metadata, skills list, Zod schemas, dependencies. Always loaded.
- **Implementation** (lazy) — `publish()`, bootstrap seeders, heavy business logic. Loaded on demand via `import()`.

This enables the registry to know *what* every module can do without loading *how* it does it.

### Phase 3: Runtime module loader (Long-term)
Introduce a runtime module-loader that reads module manifests from the database, enabling:
- **Hot-install** — add modules without rebuild (Odoo app-store model)
- **Per-tenant configuration** — different module sets per deployment
- **Community marketplace** — third-party modules loaded at runtime
- **FlowPilot skill discovery** — agent discovers new capabilities without code changes

Trade-offs: requires runtime dependency resolution, loses some TypeScript compile-time safety, adds startup latency for async loading. Mitigated by keeping manifests statically typed and validating at registration time.

### Current state (April 2026)
All 68 modules use `defineModule()` with static imports. Registration happens at build-time in `ModuleRegistry` constructor. Enabled/disabled is a runtime flag that controls UI visibility and pre-flight checks — not code loading.
