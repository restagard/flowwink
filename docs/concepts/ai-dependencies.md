# AI Dependencies in FlowWink

This document lists all AI-dependent features in FlowWink and their configuration requirements.

## Overview

FlowWink uses AI in multiple areas of the application. All AI features support multiple providers:
- **OpenAI** (Recommended) - Industry standard, reliable
- **Google Gemini** - Cost-effective alternative
- **Local LLM** - HIPAA-compliant, self-hosted
- **N8N Webhook** - Custom agentic workflows

## AI Provider Configuration

Models are chosen **once**, in **Site Settings → System AI** — the AI map: a **Provider** (OpenAI, Gemini, Anthropic or Local LLM; only providers with a key or endpoint are selectable) and, per provider, a **Chat & Interaction Model** (fast tier) and a **Research & Reasoning Model** (reasoning tier). Every surface resolves through this map (`resolveAiConfig()` in `supabase/functions/_shared/ai-config.ts`); a surface never picks a model of its own.

The public chat has one decision of its own, under **AI Chat → Provider → Provider for this chat**: *Follow the platform AI* (default) or pin the chat to a cloud provider that has a key. A pin changes the provider only — the models are still the map's for that provider. The case it exists for: the system AI is a private endpoint (FlowWork, FlowPilot, all business data) while the visitor chat may answer from a cloud model, or the reverse. Anthropic cannot be pinned for the chat (the chat streams OpenAI-style SSE); with no key for the pinned provider the ladder answers from the map and flags the fallback in the logs.

### OpenAI
```bash
# Supabase Secrets
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```
Then pick it in **System AI → Provider** and set its two models.

### Google Gemini
```bash
# Supabase Secrets
GEMINI_API_KEY=...
```
Then pick it in **System AI → Provider** and set its two models.

### Anthropic
```bash
# Supabase Secrets
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```
Selectable in **System AI**. Not pinnable for the public chat.

### Local LLM (Private)
Endpoint URL (e.g. `https://your-llm.internal/v1`), model name (e.g. `llama3`) and an optional API key are configured on the **Local LLM** card in **Integrations** — they are one thing. **System AI** then offers **Local LLM** as a provider. Vision (image / PDF) requests fall through to the first cloud provider with a key, since a local model has no vision support in this ladder.

### N8N Webhook (Agentic)
An alternative engine for the visitor chat only, under **AI Chat → Provider**: select **N8N Webhook**, enter the webhook URL, configure trigger mode and keywords.

## AI-Dependent Features

### 1. AI Chat Assistant
**Location:** Visitor-facing chat widget, chat block, chat landing page

**Purpose:** Answer visitor questions using Context Augmented Generation (CAG) based on your Knowledge Base, blog posts, and page content.

### 3. AI Text Generation (Editor Toolbar)
**Location:** All text editors (Tiptap) throughout admin panel

**Purpose:** Generate, improve, expand, summarize, translate, and continue text content.

**Backing service:** `chat-completion` (called by the shared `<AITiptapToolbar>` via `useAITextGeneration` — these are utilities, not skills; see Law 3)

**Actions:**
- **Expand** - Make text longer with more details
- **Improve** - Enhance clarity and quality
- **Summarize** - Create concise summary
- **Continue** - Generate continuation
- **Translate** - Translate to other languages

### 3. Content Migration (AI Page Import)
**Location:** Admin → Pages → Import Page

**Purpose:** Import content from any website (WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, Shopify, etc.) and convert to FlowWink blocks using AI.

**Features:**
- **Platform Detection:** Automatically detects CMS platform (WordPress, Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, Shopify, Ghost, HubSpot, Drupal, SiteVision, Episerver) for optimized extraction
- **Hero Video Extraction:** Detects HTML5 background videos (MP4/WebM) commonly used in hero sections, preserving them as video backgrounds in imported hero blocks
- **Video Extraction:** Finds YouTube and Vimeo videos embedded on the page
- **Direct Video Support:** Extracts direct video file URLs (MP4, WebM, MOV) from video tags, data attributes, and background styles
- **Lottie Animation Extraction:** Detects Lottie animations from:
  - `<lottie-player>` and `<dotlottie-player>` web components
  - `<dotlottie-wc>` elements
  - `<amp-bodymovin-animation>` (AMP)
  - `lottie.loadAnimation()` and `bodymovin.loadAnimation()` script calls
  - Data attributes referencing .lottie or .json files
  - lottie.host and lottiefiles.com URLs
- **SVG Animation Extraction:** Detects animated SVGs:
  - External SVG files with animation hints in class names
  - Inline SVGs with SMIL animations (`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`, `<animateMotion>`)
  - Inline SVGs with CSS keyframe animations
- **Image Extraction:** Extracts all images including lazy-loaded and background images
- **Screenshot Context:** Captures page screenshot for AI visual analysis
- **Block Mapping:** Maps content to 33+ block types (hero, text, gallery, team, stats, testimonials, etc.)
- **Local Image Storage:** Optional download of all images to media library

**Hero Block Enhancement:**
The importer now intelligently detects hero sections with video backgrounds:
- Identifies `<video>` tags with autoplay, loop, muted attributes as hero candidates
- Extracts MP4/WebM sources and poster images
- Creates hero blocks with `backgroundType: 'video'` when video is found
- Falls back to OG image as `backgroundType: 'image'` when no video is present

**Animation Block Support:**
Lottie and SVG animations are imported as "embed" blocks with the animation URL, allowing for later playback or conversion to native animation components.

**Edge Function:**
- `migrate-page` (scraping + AI conversion)

**Configuration:**
- Uses OpenAI (gpt-4o) or Gemini (gemini-2.0-flash-exp) for AI analysis
- Requires Firecrawl for enhanced web scraping

**API Keys Used:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` (for AI conversion)
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` (for web scraping with screenshot support)

---

### 4. Company Enrichment (CRM)
**Location:** Admin → CRM → Companies (automatic enrichment)

**Purpose:** Automatically extract company information (description, industry, size, etc.) from company websites.

**Backing services:**
- `enrich_company` skill (`internal:` handler run by `agent-execute`, AI extraction)
- Firecrawl (web scraping, via `browser-fetch`/`web-scrape`)

**Configuration:**
- Uses the AI map (System AI) like every other internal tool
- Automatically triggered when adding company with website

**API Keys Used:**

**Purpose:** Automatically score and qualify leads based on form submissions and company data.

**Backing service:** `qualify_lead` skill (`internal:` handler run by `agent-execute` — deterministic point-based scoring)

**Configuration:**
- Uses the same AI provider as Chat Settings
- Automatically triggered on new lead creation
- Optional: Can be disabled if AI not configured

**API Keys Used:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY` (optional)

> **Note:** FlowWink is a self-hosted project. The only supported AI providers are **OpenAI**, **Gemini**, and **Local LLM** (plus N8N as a custom-flow proxy). No managed/hosted AI gateways are used.

## Troubleshooting

### "AI service not configured" error
- Check that you have added the appropriate API key to Supabase Secrets
- Verify the API key is valid and has credits
- Check Admin → Integrations to see which services are configured

### Chat not responding
- Check Admin → Chat Settings → AI Provider is selected
- Verify API key in Supabase Secrets
- Check Supabase Edge Function logs for errors

### Text generation not working
- Ensure Chat Settings has a valid AI provider (OpenAI or Gemini)
- Check that the API key has sufficient credits
- Try regenerating if first attempt fails

### Content migration fails
- Requires both AI provider AND Firecrawl API key
- Check that the URL is accessible
- Some websites block scraping - try a different source

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit API keys to git**
   - Always use Supabase Secrets
   - Never hardcode keys in code

2. **Use environment-specific keys**
   - Different keys for development and production
   - Rotate keys regularly

3. **Monitor usage**
   - Set up billing alerts in OpenAI/Gemini dashboard
   - Monitor Supabase Edge Function invocations

4. **Consider Local LLM for sensitive data**
   - HIPAA-compliant option
   - Full data sovereignty
   - No data leaves your infrastructure
